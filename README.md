Pull requests are welcome; most contributors will be interested in modifying files in the `/bitcoin-information` directory or `lightning-information.html` which are my lists of educational resources.

Judgement criteria for submission of new resources is completely arbitrary based upon my own whims, but in general:

* Resources that are highly similar to existing resources need to be substantially better in some way.
* Resources that are clearly built as referral revenue mechanisms will be rejected.
* Services that are new and have the potential to be scams will be held indefinitely until they have proven their reputation.

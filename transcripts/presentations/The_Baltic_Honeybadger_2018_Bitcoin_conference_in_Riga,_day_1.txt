Okay.
Welcome, everyone, to Riga.
Welcome to Baltic County Badger 2018.
I'm here with Domek.
She's from Hong Kong Bitcoin Association.
Great guys.
I was at the conference this year, and they're helping us out with this conference as well.
So she's going to introduce speakers and help everyone out.
And, of course, you can ask me as well.
So thanks, everyone, for coming.
It's a huge crowd this year.
And I just want to make a couple of technical announcements.
So, first of all, just remember, be excellent to each other.
You know, we have people from all over the world here.
We don't care where you're from.
We don't care what your height is.
We don't care how old are you.
We don't care about those things.
So be excellent to each other.
The other thing is the after party starts at 6 o'clock here.
And please wear the badges, because unless you have them, they're not going to let you in.
So for today and tomorrow, you need to wear the badges.
So last year we had a couple of guys from Australia and Max bought them beers.
I was supposed to do the same thing this year,
except that this year I think we actually have two gentlemen from New Zealand,
if you can, guys, identify yourself.
Yes.
That was รป how long did you fly?
42 hours.
42 hours. Okay.
Was it business or economy?
Economy.
Okay.
Yeah, so this is pretty much it for the technical announcements.
I would like to say a few words about our co-organizers.
They really did a great job here on-site in Riga, SD Ventures, and Oracle Townspace.
You probably remember last year we had the second day at their co-working space.
So let's give them a round of applause as well.
They're doing a great job here.
All right, so Dominique, would you like to say a couple of words?
Yes, thanks so much for having me.
I'm so honored to help at this conference.
So my name is Dominique, and I'm from the Bitcoin Association,
and I will be introducing the speakers, just going to say a few sentences about them.
So without further ado, let me start with the first one.
Ex-pilot and serial entrepreneur Eric Voskull has an inclination to open-source projects.
He's the lead developer of the Bitcoin free and open-source high-performance Bitcoin developer toolkit.
He also authored Cryptoeconomics, a comprehensive volume on Bitcoin principles.
Today, Eric will talk about the reserve currency fallacy.
Eric, please have the stage.
Thanks, Dominique.
Max, Roman, awesome, thanks again.
Developers, developers, developers!
All right, it wasn't that bad.
So I have this problem.
I'm old and I have glasses and I can't read my slides,
so I'm going to be looking back and forth at the big slides, so bear with me.
That's me, that's you guys.
I was here last year.
I forget what I talked about.
All right, so there's a lot of content to explain this concept, reserve currency fallacy.
It's very hard to kind of get through it in the amount of time we have,
so I'm going to go quickly.
I'll be available for questions at party time or anytime, be here next couple days.
So just to put things in perspective, we're going to go through these four slides
to talk about kind of the history of this question of scaling.
Sorry.
So the first public discussion of Bitcoin was this post and the following post on the right.
Probably you're familiar with this if you've been around at all.
So Satoshi said, I've been working on a new electronic cash system
that's fully peer-to-peer with no trusted third party,
and the first response was James A. Donald, and two days later,
we very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal,
it does not seem to scale to the required size.
First problem identified very clearly.
So Satoshi's response was the first scaling proposal.
Big blocks.
So we've been dealing with that for a while.
We kind of know where that has ended up.
Satoshi was wrong, and we'll talk later about how and why, but this isn't going to work.
Okay.
Second scaling proposal.
This is Hal Finney.
Sorry about the small text.
I thought it was useful to get it out there.
Maybe too small for everybody to read, and this is kind of one of the most important slides,
so I'm just going to read through it.
There is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist,
issuing their own digital cash currency redeemable for Bitcoins.
Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world
be broadcasting to everyone and included in the blockchain.
There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems,
which is lighter weight and more efficient.
Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize
will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.
Bitcoin-backed banks will solve these problems.
They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency.
Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative,
some will be fraction reserve, while others may be 100% Bitcoin-backed.
Interest rates may vary, cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.
George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail
and argues that such a system would be stable, inflation-resistant, and self-regulating.
I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin to be the high-powered money
that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash.
Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks to settle net transfers.
Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as well as Bitcoin-based purchases are today.
Hal Finney, 2010.
That may be the second scaling proposal.
I'm not a historian, so if anybody is aware of an earlier one, let me know.
I just throw that up there because it's an interesting example of how
the first two major Bitcoin contributors were very wrong about scaling.
Now, this, despite being an ancient scaling proposal that we seem to have moved past,
seems to be an idea that we just can't kill, so I'm here to try to help people kill it.
Some of those terms in there should concern people that have been around for a while.
Should I just point at you?
Alright, that's much better.
Okay, so modern scaling proposals. This is not exhaustive. I don't work on these things.
I work on Bitcoin exclusively because that's the Bitcoin. That's where we are right now.
So I try not to comment too much on them.
But these are more modern scaling proposals.
Side chains, drive chains, lightning network.
Everybody familiar with these?
Anyone? Hands up if you've ever heard of any of these.
Alright, good, good.
So why are we doing this? Why don't we just do Hal Finney's idea or Satoshi's idea?
Because they don't work.
Okay, so these ideas all implicitly reject the early...
Thanks.
There seems to be some delay.
Okay, so these implicitly reject early proposal flaws.
One, the need for large scale participation.
That was Satoshi's idea, right?
These don't, intentionally, explicitly.
Well, implicitly, right? By design.
And they reject reliance on systems subject to authority, which is the flaw in Hal's idea.
So do you need any authority to participate in any of these things? No.
To participate in the banking system? Yes. It's a little different.
So why are we still talking about reserve currency?
Some people might argue it's a terminology issue, but I assure you it is not.
I've debated this many times with people who are very fond of this idea.
It's not a terminology distinction.
Lightning network is not a reserve system. It's a layer. They're very different.
It's just Bitcoin.
So when we're talking about a reserve currency, we're talking about something else.
We're talking about what Hal was talking about.
Okay, so four more slides.
I'm going to just basically give a high level overview of what Bitcoin is,
because that tends to not be well understood, or at least not commonly agreed.
Wrong part of the stage.
Okay, so conceptually, what is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a class of cryptocurrencies. It's a concept, not a chain.
That's an implementation, right?
And this is my terminology. You don't have to like it, but just so that I can be consistent.
It's a confirmation market. It's a market for confirming transactions.
Merchants want to get their transactions confirmed,
and miners want to sell them that confirmation, analogous to the Visa network, right?
Buying confirmation.
So these systems all share a common security model, which was first outlined in Satoshi's white paper.
So as you see in the picture, merchants, miners, buy, sell. That's the market.
And Bitcoin intends to produce a free market,
where they can buy and sell at whatever price they want.
So what's the value proposition of Bitcoin?
Why is it better than other monies that have come before?
The specific reason is it gets the state out of the market to the best of its ability, not entirely.
So it minimizes what I call the money tax, right?
Direct taxation, monetary inflation, foreign exchange controls, regulatory controls, financial surveillance, right?
Bitcoin tries to help people avoid those things.
That's why it's valuable.
If you say, well, no, I like it because I can program money.
Well, guess why you can't program other monies?
Because of these things.
I worked extensively in the PayPal APIs, the Amazon flexible payment service APIs,
I've done other companies unrelated to Bitcoin in the past before Bitcoin,
and this stuff's a pain in the ass because of the law, chargebacks, et cetera.
So even if you're only interested in the programmatic aspect of Bitcoin,
you won't have it unless you keep the state out of the money.
So this does not mean that Bitcoin will eliminate the state or that it will eliminate tax or that it will eliminate banking.
But it may result in more transparent taxation.
People will be able to see better that they're being taxed.
So this is the model where you have the market, which is basically the previous diagram I showed,
where you have merchants and miners transacting, buying and selling confirmations,
and you have the state intervening as a third party in that market, which it does in all markets,
taking a cut through its ability to control.
So that's the anti-market force that Bitcoin intends to help people resist.
Excuse me a second here.
Go ahead and read ahead.
Okay, so I'm cutting a lot of corners and presenting this differently than I usually do because of time.
So what the state wants from a money is two things.
They want to be able to authorize what transactions occur,
which you can see in the existing electronic financial system.
That allows the state to tax what's happening because they can see it.
So if it's authorized, it's taxable. It's no longer opaque to the state.
The other thing they want is the ability to issue new units of the currency to itself.
That's what we call monetary inflation.
Or the state will call it monetary policy.
So the state wants monetary policy, and they want financial surveillance.
Financial surveillance comes from the mining side of the market.
If you can prevent a miner from mining a transaction unless it's authorized by the state,
now you have financial surveillance.
You can prevent people from transacting if you don't like them to,
and you can require them to provide identity in order to transact.
So the state wants that. They have to get that from miners.
Merchants have no say in that.
Miners get to decide what transactions are getting confirmed.
Merchants are just paying them for it anonymously.
So the other thing they want is inflation or monetary policy.
Well, you get that from merchants.
You have to get the merchants who are accepting the money
and validating and trade for stuff to accept the new rule.
If they don't accept that rule, you don't get to introduce your new units of coin,
and therefore you don't have monetary policy.
So when I refer to Fedcoin, I'm just referring to this abstract concept of a coin
that causes the merchant to accept the rule change
and that causes miners to accept censorship.
Okay, so each side of the market, the merchants and miners,
secure their own half of the market independently.
Remember, buyers and sellers coming together for mutual benefit.
Miners and merchants are working together,
despite what a lot of people will tell you about the Bitcoin security model.
It's not designed to protect miners from merchants and vice versa.
It's designed to protect the market from the state.
They're working together for mutual benefit,
which is why a lot of times when you see analysis of the security model,
you see, well, there's no financial incentive for miners to attack the market
or, you know, merchants to hard fur cloth miners.
These things don't make sense. Well, of course they don't.
They're working together. Why are they going to attack each other, right?
It breaks the market.
The security model, again, is the market defending itself from the state,
and these two halves of the market must do so independently.
If you could accept these rule changes,
you've eliminated the value proposition,
which is, of course, what Bitcoiners want.
They want to protect the value proposition,
and the state wants to eliminate it
so it can retain its monetary policy and censorship.
Okay, so Bitcoin goes through four phases, or, you know, doesn't.
But as it progresses, becomes more mature,
it's either going to go through these phases
or it's going to stop in one of them.
Right now, we're in the honeymoon phase.
It doesn't have enough of an impact for the state to care.
It's not worth it, then people will care,
and it will be called money laundering, right?
So the easiest thing, I hear people say,
well, the state can't ban Bitcoin.
Well, that's nonsense.
The state can't ban popular things.
The state only bans popular things that are more profitable.
Think of all the things that are banned,
things that people like to do, right?
Even gold, for a long time, was just banned for use as money.
So the first thing the state will do
when it wants to make a change to this model
is to just make accepting Bitcoin without its Fedcoin rule
or mining it without its authorization illegal.
So now Bitcoin is what?
It's a black market money.
If you're using it, if you're accepting it,
or you're mining it, you're a criminal.
That's inevitable if we have enough of an impact.
If we don't have enough of an impact,
the stayward is now, and who cares, right?
But it's not rational to assume that this won't happen
if we're winning, right?
It's the easiest tool the state has.
So once that doesn't work
because people keep doing black market things
because they like to do them and it's worth it to them,
they'll pull up this presentation
or one of the dozen others I've given and say,
what does Eric say we should do next?
You should start mining, right?
Because you can do that centrally.
In a black market, you know, drugs, prostitution,
gambling, anything that's kind of broadly illegal
in a lot of places,
Bitcoin can be attacked from one place,
actually more optimally from one place, right,
by just mining.
So then you get your 51% attack.
So the question is,
how does Bitcoin secure itself from this?
Transactions are getting censored,
they're not getting mined, you've got a giant state mine,
and people are trying to get their
unauthorized transactions confirmed,
and they're not getting confirmed. What happens?
If you submit a transaction and it doesn't get confirmed,
what do you do?
Anyone?
Raise your fee, right?
Okay, so your unauthorized transaction is not getting confirmed,
you don't know why, you just raise your fee.
Everybody starts raising their fees on these transactions
that aren't getting confirmed. What happens?
The state miner doing the 51% attack
is not mining these transactions.
But now there's all this extra money, premium to be made,
by every other miner.
So, more hash power comes in to take this premium
through competition,
you know, power is regulated,
and all of a sudden, the free market has more than 50%,
and the transactions start getting confirmed.
So what does the state do?
Does it start taking the unauthorized transactions?
Does it just give up?
Because it's losing the 51% attack?
Maybe.
Or maybe it raises taxes to subsidize
its mining operation, right?
Before, it didn't have to, because it's profitable,
mining's profitable, it didn't have to raise taxes
to run a 51% attack, right?
It's making a profit. But as soon as it stops taking
higher fee transactions,
it starts losing money.
So taxes have to get raised
to offset the fee premium that people are paying
on black market transactions.
That's the Bitcoin security model.
That's how Bitcoin resists censorship.
People will tell you, Bitcoin resists censorship
because the state can't get mining hardware.
I don't know how many times I've heard that.
It's preposterous.
It's economically irrational to think the state can't get
what everybody else can get.
It'll be too expensive or something, I don't know.
Mining is profitable.
Okay, so that's...
Bitcoin doesn't have to go through these phases,
it'll probably cycle through these phases if it does,
but this is the design of Bitcoin.
It intends for this to happen.
Right?
Okay, so, my last slide.
How much time do I have?
Negative 10? Something like that?
Alright, I'll try to be...
So here's the slide, it's so hard.
In the 30 seconds.
Okay.
So based on the previous half-finished slide,
you probably have some idea of why reserve currency
is not a good idea.
But basically, if you understand the security model,
who's preventing, in Bitcoin generally today,
whenever, who's preventing
the state from stepping in
and forcing merchants
to change a rule
to accept inflation?
Who prevents that?
Merchants, right?
They say, no, I'm not doing that.
How do they do that?
Just like all the businesses in town just say,
sorry, I'm violating the law.
You know? No.
They either accept it
or they hide. That's how black markets work.
That's why decentralization matters.
Being small allows you to hide.
Both on the mining side and on the merchanting side.
So,
if these merchants who are hiding
and accepting Bitcoin for
drugs or gambling or whatever,
decide that they're going to take
actual Bitcoin, then Bitcoin keeps working.
And they're
the defense, right?
It's called risk sharing.
So,
if the state is buying Bitcoin
from all of us
with paper, right?
Like how Phinney suggested, state prints the paper,
buys your Bitcoin, they now have your Bitcoin,
whose receipt
eventually becomes the global reserve.
So, all these state-backed banks
are holding this Bitcoin.
They're receiving it, right? And eventually they're settling
amongst themselves like they used to do with gold.
So, who's validating
Bitcoin in a trade?
Just the state.
That's it.
Everybody else is moving paper around. And the state's got
Bitcoin and they validate amongst themselves. So, they can tell themselves,
well, I won't take your bad Bitcoin. Or they can all get together
and say, hey, let's just add inflation because
we like that. And they will.
And so, they won't be using Bitcoin anymore. Bitcoin will be
that smaller black market thing that we still do.
So, it won't exist as a
reserve currency because it'll fail in that way.
There's
theories that you could audit
it. You could somehow
have the state prove
its reserve, which I don't know why it would do it.
But say it did. Here's our reserve.
How do you prove how many dollars and euros have been printed against
that reserve?
They used to publish those numbers. We used to trust them.
I don't even publish them in the U.S. anymore.
There's no way to do that.
Auditing is a fallacy in Bitcoin. You cannot audit
something that's somehow bound
to Bitcoin. You can do Lightning, which is
a coupling. They're not decoupled at all.
But that's one-to-one. There's no reason for the state to
even care about that because they can't ever inflate it.
So, a reserve
is this idea that we go back to
what the gold standard was.
Was the gold standard everybody using gold?
Like everybody uses Bitcoin?
No. The gold standard
was fiat.
The gold standard, some people say
it worked really well until it didn't.
But that's the whole point. It didn't.
The gold standard was the state buying gold with paper
and then keeping all the gold.
Double win. Now I can inflate the paper
and I can spend the gold.
So, the gold standard was a catastrophe.
It basically
took everybody's gold. And the Bitcoin standard
would be pretty much the same thing
except the state now controls
the determination of what's actually valid.
Okay, so
I think I got it all.
There's some
really interesting discussions there
but I'm probably over time.
Any questions?
Okay.
The end.
Applause
Is somebody managing questions on here?
Just throw a hand up then.
In the back, with the hand up.
Blue shirt.
So one of the scenarios
might be that
China and the United States both disagree
on what's a valid transaction and they're both mining
and you end up seeing
state level mining competition which
stabilizes that
problem.
Okay.
What do you see? Do you see that happening?
This is what happens now.
Multiple people mine. If they don't get to
50% it's kind of irrelevant.
As long as people can validate their own
and have a full copy.
We saw it with Yousaf during the fork
last year. 80%
of the miners were behind SegWit2X
and then they all folded 24 hours
before because the majority
of the market seemed to be on the
Bitcoin core side.
Maybe we'll see something like that again.
Honeymoon phase. It's not under attack by the state.
The market's not attacking itself.
It's working.
But
it's not going to go into state
mining attacks which are basically
subsidizing mining with hash power at presumably
high expense because it's worth it.
We're not going to see that unless it does the first
thing which is to write down on a little piece of paper
this is illegal. So if you haven't
seen that yet we're still in the honeymoon phase.
It's just a big waste
of state tax money
if they don't do that.
Because imagine what happens.
People think this
can't happen for some reason. I have no idea why.
Dominic said I was a pilot.
I was a military pilot. I was a tactics
instructor. I flew adversarial
tactics against western fighters and said
I taught this stuff. And I was always amazed
at how naive people would be about
the threat. They just assumed
it was stupid and slow
and under this and under that. And it's not.
It's capable. It's smart.
It's powerful. You can't make these
assumptions about the threat.
Anyway. Questions?
Hi. So in your
definition slide of
Bitcoin you mentioned that it's
a market between users and miners.
Merchants and miners. Users
ambiguous. I have no idea what that means.
So that's on the one
hand. But on the other hand you also said that it's
defined by the Bitcoin white paper.
Couldn't the market
bring it in a state that's conflicting actually
with the white paper?
So I hate the
appeal to authority thing that is
implied when I say okay it's defined in the white paper.
That's not my intent. The white paper
describes a set of concepts that are implemented
in the coin. And they're very
general concepts. How Bitcoin is secured.
One is risk sharing. One is power
energy syncing and one is power
balancing. And I didn't talk at all
about those because I don't have time but
I got a whole presentation on that at scaling in Tokyo.
So great. Go see that.
But that's really what I'm talking about. Those concepts that
actually make it work.
White paper
implementation whatever. All I'm trying to point out
is that there can be more than one implementation of those
concepts and that's still
what would you call that? A cryptocurrency?
That's too general. It's really Bitcoin.
With the big B.
BTC is a chain. It's got a
genesis block. But the genesis block is not in the white paper.
The block interval is not in the
white paper. Those things are not necessary
to be a Bitcoin.
Isn't it hard for the
state to write a piece of paper
that we ban Bitcoin if
most of the state's politicians
become corrupted with Bitcoin
because they think it's untraceable?
That's the political argument. Bitcoin's a political
money. In other words, wouldn't it
be hard to steal everyone's gold
if all the politicians have gold
or in the back pockets of big
businesses and bankers that like gold?
Apparently not.
But maybe.
The point is that Bitcoin is not a political money.
It's not secured by the vote.
By the political vote.
By the king. By the
governor. Whatever. If it was, it would just be
the money we already have because we already have the option
to fix those monies with the vote.
So to buy
off politicians with paper dollars
or gold. We have that option and it hasn't
worked.
Stop me anytime.
One of my worries is that if the ETF
does come and it's fully backed by Bitcoin
that a lot of Wall Street will be trading
and there will be a lot of Bitcoin backing the ETF
and that becomes
at risk of confiscation by the government
like they took away the gold from the banks.
Is that a concern
for you? If let's say 10 to 20 percent
of all Bitcoin backing an ETF
that the government can come in and swoop up
causing a lack of confidence?
Yeah, it's a good question and I don't generally speak
in my concerns. I'm just trying to describe how things
work. So the point raised is
there's one person that has an ETF
whoever has actual control over
the ETF like the
head of the board or whatever
the shareholders appoint to run the ETF.
And then there's all these people who
hold shares in the ETF which are promises
to get back something at some point.
And in that
case the ETF owner
controller is one node in the security
graph. The other people aren't even participating.
They're not validating receipt
of Bitcoin in trade for something so they're just not using
Bitcoin. So is it possible that
one big holder of Bitcoin like
a Coinbase or an ETF
could be
attacked by the state? Yeah, of course.
Yeah, they're big public entities. Sure.
Why not? Very easy.
That's the point. Bitcoin
in order to be securable
it has to be able to operate at
small scale. That's why decentralization
matters. Decentralization is not some magic
feature. It's a way for people to hide.
It's
making
the implementation possible to operate at
small scale. If it's only possible
to mine at very large scale
or to merchant at very large scale
so think about keeping your nodes
operating small, then
you can't hide. So you'll be this
big institutions will have all
the stuff and will be like
reserve currency and
who gets to validate
the Bitcoin when it's a reserve currency and we're
holding paper? The state. One person.
They do what they want with it. So yeah
the larger and more visible things become
for one entity that controls it
the more risk there is that the entity is going to be compromised
and
all the other people who think they're actually
using Bitcoin are not because they're not.
Anyone else?
Four minutes.
Four minutes.
When the laws
are passed.
I love those like you know ask
me when things are going to happen thing.
So I really try to avoid
making statements about things that can't be known.
People do that all the time.
The price is going to here. This is going to happen.
State can't do this. There's no way to know.
In that hash power battle between
the state and the market, fees
rising to get transactions confirmed and the
state raising taxes to counter
that. Who wins?
There's no way to know that.
I work on Bitcoin. I've been working on
the Bitcoin for five years
full time. Never been paid.
I like it. I love Bitcoin.
People hear me talk like this like
I always do and they say well you're so pessimistic
you know. Isn't it
guaranteed it's going to work? No.
It's not. But that doesn't mean
it's not worthwhile and
there's no way to know who wins that
battle because there's no way to know how much somebody
is willing to pay to get their transactions confirmed
and there's no way to know how much the state is willing
to sacrifice in order to prevent it.
But presumably it will be
pretty close. That value
will get to the point where
somebody has to give up. That's the
surrender phase, the last phase. Somebody has to give up because you can't
perpetually lose money on one side.
That's the consequence of a 51% attack.
So somebody gives up, then it goes back
to become more centralized and then we go back into the
same cycle again. But when?
I don't know.
Two minutes.
That's one question.
Sir?
Mike?
Okay.
For the recording, what about smaller states that decide
to join the black market
and allow Bitcoin to be mined and transacted within
their borders, right? They just become part of
the black market. So when I
talk about state, it's an abstraction. It's the set of
all the people with all the guns that make you do things.
If some group of people in some
region decide they don't, fine.
But the security model remains
the same, right? That
bigger group or maybe the smaller group can still
declare it illegal and make everybody in their
control
illegal, you know,
a money launderer if they want to. And that's the case
today, right? Some places you do some money laundering,
some places, you know, you're fine.
But then as it continues
to happen, there will be people within
the banning states
control that are still doing it, right?
They're the black marketeers. But then there'll be
rogue nations,
right? And we have that today, too. It'll be
I don't know, whoever's
subject to global financial controls
today, like Iran maybe, I don't know who else.
But they're just part of the black market. The formula is still
the same.
And, all right?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, Eric.
Our next speaker
is
the creator of the
Bitcoin fiber project.
Fred and Christine are going to
introduce six
misconceptions about Bitcoin.
Matt, please take the stage.

So everyone awake?
Now?
All right.
Okay, whoo, that is bright.
Cool, yeah, so thanks for that, Eric.
I'm going to talk, I mean, that was maybe more idealistic, and I'm going to do something
vaguely similar, but maybe a bit more from the utility and kind of why people use Bitcoin
at an angle, and we'll see how that goes.
Cool.
Yeah, so I want to talk about this concept of trustlessness.
You know, people use the word decentralization a lot, and I find that to be kind of useless
because decentralization is kind of just a means to an end.
We use Bitcoin because we don't want to trust someone, and decentralization is just kind
of a fuzzy word, whereas trustlessness, you can actually assign some meaning to it.
You know, if people didn't read the old Reed Dilliger piece on LinkedIn, it was really
great, you should go back and read it, but it was about the history of eCash and where
Bitcoin came out of, the community that existed in the 80s and 90s, and that really clearly
birthed Bitcoin, and he talks a lot about various attempts at building eCash systems
and why they all failed, and kind of brings it all back to, at the end of the day, you
had to trust someone, and there's a lot of different forms of that, whether you just
had to trust someone to continue to exist and stay in business, or whether you had to
trust them to not seize your coins, or whether you had to trust them for whatever reason,
and they all failed for that reason.
And so in Eric's posting of the original Satoshi announcement, you saw that it says where you
don't have to trust anyone.
That was in his announcement email in his, like, whatever, one sentence, two sentence
blurb.
So, you know, let's talk a little bit about what forms this actually takes in Bitcoin
and what people care about and why people use Bitcoin.
It's interesting to look at from the point of view of this kind of digital gold versus
payments argument, and while I think that's kind of a useless way to view cryptocurrency
and the value of cryptocurrency, it is interesting to look at from the perspective of what that
implies for trusting and what that implies for why you care about Bitcoin.
So obviously there's kind of the digital gold aspect of secure settlement, where you want
to only trust your own node, you want to verify the chain, hopefully without inflation, and
you get this really nice property.
You can run your own node, you can verify all the rules, and you can see visibly on
your own node the hash rate.
You can see it add up, you can calculate it, you can do some back of the envelope, you
can say, well, a certain amount of power went into confirming these transactions.
Maybe you wait a week, maybe you wait a month.
There's various other issues with mining today.
So you wait a while, but you can still accept this transaction.
You can say, okay, I know for sure without trusting anyone, I don't trust central bank,
I don't trust the Fed, I don't trust government of Venezuela, if you're Venezuelan, whatever
form that takes.
On the other hand, we have this kind of payments view of trust, where people are trying to
avoid trusting PayPal, Visa, someone maybe more direct, and so you're looking at Bitcoin
from a lens of, okay, you want faster payments, you care about not necessarily waiting a week,
where the entire modern financial infrastructure is built around this idea of, yes, we can
come together, we can agree, yes, we agree Visa is reputable, if Visa says I've paid
you a dollar, I've paid you a dollar.
Whereas people might not necessarily want that for various reasons.
Maybe you're censored because you are a marijuana grower in the U.S. or various other places
in the world.
Maybe you are in a place where Visa just doesn't work, whatever it is, you want to be able
to use Bitcoin without necessarily trusting someone like that.
So there's this interesting concept that comes up, right?
So we have this wonderful Bitcoin system, we have this hash rate that you can see, you
can see transactions coming through, but is that enough?
And ultimately people like to use Bitcoin for more than just, well, I can see a transaction
and if it confirms, that's great, they care about being censored and they care about this
concept of censorship resistance and being able to get their transactions through even
if hopefully without trusting anyone else, right?
But where do we get this property?
And so this is kind of where this decentralization buzz word comes in.
I refer to it a bit slightly differently, this concept of consensus group distribution.
So that's useful to talk about consensus group distribution because it also applies to not
just proof of work but proof of stake in all these other systems.
Your consensus group is ultimately the people who are selecting the transactions and putting
them in blocks or whatever form your system takes.
And you have, so with Bitcoin we have this attempt at consensus group distribution, we
have this hash power thing and hopefully it's decentralized.
It's really not today and so that's obviously a huge open question about can we actually
build a system that is in the long term censorship resistant?
Still kind of unclear.
There's various other attempts, there's proof of stake, well, turns out stake in wealth
has always been incredibly centralized through all of human history, so that might not work
out as various other proposals but most of them are still very untested.
And Bitcoin is too, still very untested, still very experimental in terms of can we actually
build this goal, this censorship resistance that people want?
And is certainly one of the key reasons people use Bitcoin.
Of course this also comes back to community norms and so there's an interesting concept
that's developed, at least in Bitcoin today, like why does Bitcoin today actually work
and have censorship resistance if mining is so centralized?
Well it turns out that's just kind of community norms.
It turns out that people use Bitcoin for censorship resistance and so if miners started aggressively
violating that, then all of a sudden Bitcoin would have less value and the miners would
have less value in their investment.
And so this norm in the community, this kind of expectation of what should exist has ended
up playing a useful role in terms of creating this censorship resistance but I would argue
that's only temporary.
If you have the next generation of Bitcoiners or the next generation of governments or the
next generation of whatever, eventually people realize like oh well here's this pressure
point, here's exactly where we can violate this censorship resistance and get the goals
that we want by censoring payments as governments want to do.
There's another extension of this kind of community norms concept.
In Bitcoin we talk about not wanting to trust anyone, well a clear violation of not wanting
to trust anyone is if the rules change out from under you.
So this was obviously all of the old 2X and whatnot fork drama and all of the debates
there was all about who should I have to trust to use Bitcoin for the rules to change?
And I would argue Bitcoin applied this new community norm and really grew out of it and
this was where the fork happened, right?
You had one group, one part of the community which wanted different norms which wanted
to be able to change the rules more aggressively and one part of the community which wanted
a norm of you don't change the rules without broad agreement.
And so this kind of interestingly has resulted in Bitcoin being somewhat unique in the cryptocurrency
space and that we have this norm that changes don't get made very easily and because that
is the expectation of all Bitcoin users and because people kind of expect that to be a
thing they rely on for using Bitcoin, it becomes self-perpetuating that the community enforces
it because the community expects it and thus we have this nice property of not having to
trust anyone for the rules of Bitcoin whereas other cryptocurrencies might not.
There's not something inherently different, it's only about the community and the people
who are going to enforce these changes or are going to enforce these rules and enforce
them so that changes don't get made.
Oh, wait, there we go, that changed, great.
Yeah, what implications, okay, well, now all of the things got entered, that's fine, cool,
that's good, I get it, yeah, okay, so, you know, what implications do these concepts
of various types of not wanting to trust someone have on scalability and kind of how we look
to the future?
First of all, blockchains don't scale, anyone who's telling you that they have a blockchain
that scales is lying to your face, A, B is an idiot or C is simply leaving out some tradeoffs
that they've made.
There's a lot of different tradeoffs that we can play with, there's a lot of different
areas in this kind of overarching concept of not wanting to trust anyone that we can
slightly relax here or there and get a much more scalable system and all of these are
valid approaches, it's just not necessarily always the approach that Bitcoin takes.
So you know, there's some great examples, we can give up on this decentralisation of
our consensus group, we can be Ripple or we can be PayPal where there's a single entity
or there's maybe five entities or whatever who are signing all the transactions, confirming
all the transactions, of course, you probably give up some of your censorship resistance
but great, your system scales really well and you have some other features, you have
maybe programmable money or something or other, this is a valid approach.
You can also experiment with other ones, I think proof of stake probably lands in that
category as well, you're going to have relatively centralised stake and so you end up with
a consensus group that's more centralised and so maybe they have more ability to censor
but maybe you can still get some other security guarantees and that's fine, that's a valid
approach.
You can give up on this concept of self-validation, you can give up this ability to trust no-one
but your own node, everyone can be an SPV client, everyone can go only have partial
validation or they can only see some part of the network and this actually kind of encompasses
a lot of things, there's side chains and sharding and all these other concepts also fall under
this category.
If you only see part of the network, well, we can make it go a hell of a lot faster.
Of course, something could be happening that's incorrect in other parts of the network and
that might come back to bite you later, so you don't quite have this kind of digital
gold use case anymore because something else happens somewhere else in the network, all
of a sudden that attempt at not trusting anyone else, not having to go check Reddit before
you accept a payment, well, it goes out the window because something happened, people
are posting on Reddit, hey, stop accepting payments for the next week while we figure
it out and reorg the whole chain, you know, you're going to have a problem.
Again, valid approach.
You can give up a little bit on the censorship resistance assumption in other ways.
You could build a payment channel network, like a centralised payment channel network,
you still have this consensus group decentralisation, but maybe you've built something else on top
that's a bit more centralised and has, you know, someone who has the ability to censor
things, but, again, it's okay.
Some people might want that.
You can also give up everything.
You can just build a bank.
I know Eric's not a huge fan of that, but, you know, that's a legitimate use case if
someone only cares about Bitcoin because they only care about not wanting to trust the Fed
or not wanting to trust their government in Venezuela, maybe they're fine trusting Coinbase,
and if that's their use case for Bitcoin, that's their use case for Bitcoin, and they
should be able to use the version of Bitcoin that is great for them.
But, you all know, I was talking about this in the context of Bitcoin, it's interesting
because a lot of other systems in the cryptocurrency space tend to kind of make a decision, right?
You have Ripple where they're like, okay, screw it, we're not going to have much decentralisation
in our consensus group, we're going to have a few entities that are going to sign all
the transactions and confirm them, and that's fine.
You have other systems, you know, you have, like, Ethereum's talking about building in
some of these sharding techniques at the base layer, and that's great, and they're going
to give up a little bit on the self-validation approach, we'll see exactly where those trade-offs
are made as they move forward, but they're building this in for all of their users.
And so, you know, if you're using one of these systems, you're required to use that trust
model.
Bitcoin, we've tended to take a little bit of a different approach, and I think this
is a good thing, we try to avoid making a decision for people.
You know, we've been, I think, as a community, encouraging people more to build systems on
top which might give up some of the trust, or might introduce a little bit of trust in
a way that users might want, right?
So if a user wants to use a bank, they can, if a user wants to build a side chain on top
and give up a little bit on the self-validation properties, they can, but that doesn't necessarily
infect everyone else who is using the system because it's not built in, it's not baked
in, and it's not, like, required for everyone to have to use the same security model just
because the developers or whatever have decided that.
Cool.
And so, you know, what does that mean for kind of going forward?
I already covered a little bit of this, but, you know, we have to, I think, as a community,
agree that different use cases exist.
People use Bitcoin for different reasons, and we should be encouraging of whatever reason
people want to use Bitcoin for.
If they want to use an ETF because they want to hedge something or other, fine.
If they want to use Bitcoin for some reason because they're getting censored in their
payments, also fine.
If they want to use Bitcoin just to get around capital controls but are still using Coinbase
or something, okay.
If people want to use lightning and they're willing to give up a little bit on some of
the trade-offs there, some of the, whatever, some of the censorship resistance being kind
of baked in, then that's fine, right?
So lightning has this, so there's this weird kind of dichotomy of, like, yeah, I talk about
censorship resistance being key to trustlessness, and it's kind of become a part of our security
model, but it's not necessarily our security model, and it could be violated briefly.
I mean, we talk about mining being heavily centralised, well, you know, that could result
in censorship resistance being violated for a period of time, and then maybe in some way
we're able to fight back, like what Eric was talking about, whereas lightning has kind
of hoisted this censorship resistance assumption that we all make in using Bitcoin to a key
security property, and that's probably fine, you know, we'll find out, but people can choose
that if they want to, and people could also choose to not do that in the Bitcoin world,
so we have to encourage people to make different trust trade-offs where they can, but we should
also not discourage people from making trust trade-offs if they want to or if their use
case makes sense in that context, because that's actually where we get scalability of
the Bitcoin system broader, is we encourage people who only care about not trusting their
central bank to use Coinbase, to use an ETF, to use whatever it is, because they just don't
need, they don't care about some of the other properties, and if they actually do care about
the other properties, or we can convince them that they should care about the other properties
of Bitcoin, that's great, and we should do that, and we should encourage them to use
a stronger trust model in using Bitcoin, but we shouldn't necessarily discourage trust
in places where it's okay.
You know, obviously, hopefully this results in kind of a ton of different interoperable
systems, we're already seeing this in a lot of ways, we already have Bitcoin banks, we
already have lightning, but hopefully this will continue to grow, we'll get more side
chain kind of technologies, we'll get tumble bit, we'll get various other systems where
people can more granularly choose their trust model.
Of course, this results in kind of terrible UX, we have to find a reasonably accurate
way to describe the trust model that people are using to users who want to use Bitcoin,
and get them to use the thing that's most optimal for them, so it's kind of a massive
open challenge in the community of Bitcoiners, but we should find a way to kind of build
these different systems and allow users to use what they want.
We should also try to focus a little bit on the usability gaps between different trust
models, you know, obviously, Coinbase is infinitely more user friendly than Bitcoin on the chain,
and lightning is somewhere in between, and, you know, whatever, all these other systems
are somewhere in between on this scale, but we should try to reduce those differences
where we can, lightning, or Coinbase is always going to be more user friendly than Bitcoin
on the chain, and it's always going to be more user friendly to build a centralised
system and utilise trust in an efficient way than to use a completely trustless system
or a completely trustless way to use Bitcoin.
But we should try to reduce those differences where we can, because people who do want to
use Bitcoin without trusting anyone shouldn't be unable to do so or shouldn't be discouraged
from doing so just because the usability is really terrible on chain versus using Coinbase.
Finally, of course, I think everyone in this room would strongly agree and is playing an
important part of continuing to set good community precedent, because, you know, even while hash
power is centralised and even while we don't necessarily have all of the properties that
we want out of Bitcoin in the long term or guaranteed the properties, if we continue
to push heavily and say, look, miners shouldn't censor transactions, and, if they do, we'll
riot in the streets or something, at least that buys us time and at least that keeps
them from doing so as we try to deploy technologies and deploy more hash power and whatever it
is to make that more decentralised, and as we move hopefully in a better direction and
get to a point where we're kind of guaranteed the properties we want because we have distribution
in our consensus group, before we can get there, we need to make sure we have things
kind of continue to work as they do today, and that comes down to setting community norms
and saying, look, you can't change the rules out from under me, and, look, miners shouldn't
censor transactions and whatever else it is.
Cool.
Thanks.
Questions?
This is a question regarding the future of the Bitcoin, and my question is more related
to how do you see the adoption on a wider scale than we see presently, I mean, for common
people adopting getting into Bitcoin, especially seen in the light of what happened last year
when we saw the peak and then the downfall and now winter, how do you see Bitcoin overcoming
this in the future?
You mean overcoming?
I mean, so, you know, obviously there's user experience challenges, you know, Bitcoin,
I think, as a broad system was not ready and probably still isn't ready for kind of the
broad base adoption that we'd like to see for some use cases of Bitcoin, the user experience
is still terrible, using anything other than just going on Coinbase, clicking buy and watching
your money disappear is kind of painful in a lot of ways, and so there's a lot of different
efforts to fix that, you know, people are deploying lightning-like systems and there's
still UX challenges in lightning, people are building better wallets, hopefully, and there's
still UX challenges in doing that.
So first of all, you know, we need to actually be prepared for users coming and actually
using Bitcoin because we're still not quite there.
Second of all, you know, hopefully, you know, all of these various variants of like making
sure we have different trust models available is an important part of that.
You know, there's a lot of users who just want to invest, and that's fine, but then,
you know, we need better kind of community descriptions and better facing, you know,
when we describe Bitcoin to people, we shouldn't tell them that this is a done deal system,
you should go ahead and put your money in it because it's not, it's still very experimental.
There's still a lot we don't know, there's still a lot we don't know how things are going
to play out in the future, and, you know, maybe hash power doesn't get more decentralised,
maybe things just don't work out, maybe we continue to have bugs in software and kind
of screw ourselves.
We should be accurately explaining that to people who want to buy Bitcoin so that they're
not buying BTC or, you know, random other coins and losing all their money and getting
upset about that, and that's something that we've definitely kind of failed over the last
six to 12 months of, you know, people threw a lot of money into the space and got burned
really bad, so, yeah, hopefully we can come back from that with more accurate descriptions,
I guess.
So, do you want to say anything about the recent bug?
Was that you?
Yeah, so, no, I thought about throwing all this out and doing a talk on that, but, you
know, obviously I think things just happened and so it's too early to do a full retrospective,
I'm happy to answer any specific questions about it that people might have, but it is,
you know, obviously there's some thinking that's going to happen and, you know, spending
more time on writing up and thinking hard about what went right, what went wrong, you
know, I think the disclosure process and the kind of immediate after bath once we found
out actually went reasonably well, it was stressful and, you know, obviously things
ended up getting pretty rushed, but it turned out, you know, the decisions we made turned
out to be right, even if some of them were obviously taking a risk, but a calculated
risk and we ended up getting that right, but in terms of how the bug got added and what
needs to change to make sure that doesn't happen in the future, you know, that's still
something that at least I and I know other people are spending a lot of time thinking
about and trying to do better, but if anyone has specific questions about it, I'm happy
to answer.
Hi, Konstantin from payments.com, I have two questions to you.
So do you agree that Bitcoin should be used as digital cash or you think that Bitcoin
will be used more as a store value in the future?
And second question is if you believe in future usability of Bitcoin, do you think that the
main focus of the Bitcoin community is the merchant adoption of the Bitcoin, so actually
people who own Bitcoin, Bitcoin can spend it instead of using fiat?
Yes, I think to some extent the beauty of Bitcoin and the beauty of kind of the decisions
the Bitcoin community has made over the last few years is that we haven't locked ourselves
into anything and that we are open to a number of different use cases, you know, you asked
if I think Bitcoin will be used more for cash or payments or gold or whatever, obviously
I don't know, but I assume hopefully Bitcoin will be used for all of them and in what percentage
I have no idea, but some variant of Bitcoin the asset is going to be used for payments,
whether that's on lightning or whether that's via Bitcoin banks or whether that's even some
part of it being on chain, some part of Bitcoin will be used as a digital gold for investing
and maybe that will be via ETFs, maybe that will be via people buying on Coinbase and
maybe that will be people buying on chain.
I don't know, but all of these things will happen and I think that's kind of the beauty
of Bitcoin is that we have all of these different options, there's all of these different usability
ways to approach Bitcoin and so hopefully that just kind of keeps it open and allows
people to use Bitcoin and however they like and I don't recall what your second question
was but that's okay.
Merchant adoption, yeah I mean I think merchant adoption has some of the biggest challenges
in terms of usability, that kind of immediate payment especially kind of in person when
you're looking at very fast payment has big usability challenge that still needs to be
addressed and also of course you have the user sites, you have to be able to bring users
and merchants together, so that has material challenges, hopefully that's an option for
people to continue paying with Bitcoin, that's something where Bitcoin can really provide
value to people if you're buying from something and you are yourself censored, you know maybe
you in the US there was a famous called operation choke point where they seized the bank accounts
and like blacklisted people from getting bank accounts because they were like porn actresses
and whatever and this happened like what three years ago five years or two years ago or something
right and so if you are one of these people who's kind of getting screwed for whatever
reason having that option for merchants to go use Bitcoin is great, that doesn't necessarily
mean that everyone is going to use Bitcoin because you know some people are fine with
using Visa and maybe they'll get bitten in the ass eventually for that and maybe they
should have been using Bitcoin I don't know but you know having it as an option has a
lot of value in and of itself even if it's not that heavily used, this might be the last
question.
So on the topic of trustlessness and decentralization, so on some level the average user or most
users are trusting that the code within the core software is well developed and properly
reviewed and in that sense you were talking about decentralization of mining and that
is important to have proper decentralization there and Satoshi was of the opinion that
there could only really be one node implementation like effectively it wouldn't work to have
multiple and arguably there's adequate decentralization within the core implementation, there's hundreds
of committers, there's lots of great open development there but do you think potentially
there what's your thought about the need for competition between implementations and decentralizing
in terms of the development as well?
So there's kind of a split here I want to make, so in terms of the consensus rules themselves
obviously Bitcoin is a consensus system and consensus means definitionally that we have
to agree and so certainly having different consensus rules is not an option and I would
so kind of the way I look at having different implementations of the consensus rules is
look, if you're like a business, you're accepting payments, you are an exchange, you're accepting
deposits, you're a regular person, you're accepting payments, if you accept a payment
and your consensus rules have forked for whatever reason, then you get screwed, you get completely
screwed.
So like the variant of the bug we had last week, if we have two different consensus implementations
and they disagree in any way, it's the same bug, it's the same result for most users.
Because if there were actually inflation, we would have gone and reorged it and it would
be removed.
Like the community broadly almost without question would have said no, screw that, we're
going to make this block invalid and so if you have two different nodes, you're completely
screwed if they disagree.
And so I think for that reason, not that it's impossible, but it's a bar 100X higher than
anything is done implemented today to actually get to the point where we can safely have
multiple different consensus implementations.
That is not to say that all of the code in Bitcoin core falls into this category.
For example, there's a large part of the code in the peer-to-peer network which should have
competition.
There should be competition in terms of how you get blocks.
The way you go and download blocks from the peer-to-peer, just the implementation, but
also from that peer-to-peer network, maybe we should have other peer-to-peer networks,
we should also send them over Twitter, we should send them over satellites, we should
send them over everything.
There should be a lot of competition there.
And I very much like to see a ground-up parallel peer-to-peer implementation in Bitcoin core.
I think I'm out of time, I'm being told I'm out of time.
Maybe just the last question, just a really quick one.
Hi guys, Max with the Wellcrypto Network.
Thank you Matt for fixing that bug, that was amazing.
But maybe could you please go a bit more into the disclosure part and why there were both
the disclosure first of the node crashing and later the inflation.
So yeah, I mean really quickly, right?
So we covered it a tiny bit in the second disclosure post, so for those who haven't
read the second disclosure post, that might be instructive to go read that.
Obviously Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network, it's not like most software where you can
just upload a new version and all the servers switch to the new version and then vulnerability
is fixed.
So we're always worried about what does that upgrade process look like and how do we make
sure that we don't disclose, have the network partially upgraded and then get it exploited.
And so we decided to release the denial of service version so that we could go run around
and scream at everyone and say upgrade now.
Because that was more than enough reason for people to want to upgrade without necessarily
disclosing the actual exploit that you could have gone and done.
And so we were able to, and it actually worked pretty well, right?
We disclosed the denial of service, went around, yelled at everyone to upgrade, most businesses
and pools and whatever did, a decent chunk of the nodes upgraded, and then once it started
to kind of come out on its own and once we thought it wasn't going to be contained any
more anyway, we went ahead and disclosed the full version so that we could even more go
around and scream at people to upgrade.
All right.
Thanks.
I'm completely out of time.
Thanks, Matt.
For the next one, with a background in security, privacy and economics, Leo Weiss is the president
of the Bitcoin Association and my colleague.
Today he will moderate a discussion about the current state of the market and institutional
investors with Tone Weiss and Bruce Fenton.
Leo, please take the stage with the panelists.
I think you'll get a, well, do you have a second microphone?
I'm here with Bruce Fenton to my left.
Bruce Fenton wants to be introduced as an amateur scientist, but he's also a host of
the Satoshi Roundtable and a long-term investor.
And I'm here with Tone Weiss, a derivatives trader and content creator.
We're going to be talking about Wall Street.
I believe both of you are based in New York.
How was the last 12 months?
Maybe, Tone, you have the microphone already.
Well, I'm kind of based in New York.
I own an apartment there, but I think I spent about nine months a year everywhere else outside
of New York.
And when I'm actually in New York, that's when I have my nice workstation, so I don't
actually do anything.
I didn't even know you were in New York, Bruce.
I don't really know too many Bitcoiners in New York.
It's really amazing how you don't do much when you travel.
You don't really do much with Bitcoin in the place where you live, but you're doing a lot
everywhere else.
It's just weird that way.
Yeah, I'm in New Hampshire, actually, but I work in New York a lot, and I used to live
there.
I had a place there, and I'm on the board of a company that's there, so I'm there pretty
often.
And I sort of grew up on Wall Street and know a lot of people there.
I've kept in contact with a lot of my old colleagues and friends.
What did they say the last 12 months?
Did they all call you up and need some urgent advice?
Yeah, sometimes.
It's been years now.
They thought I was all crazy when I was talking about Bitcoin five, six years ago, and then
they got interested.
They're completely focused on the price, typically.
They don't really care much about some of the bigger picture cypherpunk issues and those
kind of things, but yeah, there's definitely a lot of interest.
There's more increased interest.
There's still a huge lack of understanding by a lot of people on Wall Street about what
the technology is and what it can do.
What stage are they at?
Are they thinking about it?
Are they slowly getting their feet wet?
Are they buying Bitcoin?
Are they still dabbling in ICOs and tokens?
So I was just going to add that, you're right, it was the same thing.
When I was talking about Bitcoin at my job back in 2013, 2014, everyone thought I was
crazy as well.
Now a few people that I was working with back then are now working in this industry and
others are looking for a job in this industry.
So that part is great that there's somebody here in the audience that I used to work with
back from between 2011 and 2013 and is also in this space.
Probably the most talked about issue when it comes to Bitcoin has been the ETF.
What are your thoughts about this?
You asked a question to Eric earlier.
Do you think an ETF is good for Bitcoin?
Do you think an ETF is likely to be approved anytime?
I don't think it's going to be approved this year, but I've been saying that for two years
now.
A lot of people thought that the Bitcoin ETF was going to get approved in March of last
year and I said that was ridiculous.
And this entire year I've been saying that it's kind of crazy by people think it's going
to get approved.
So I've been right on that front.
As far as is it good or bad for the crypto ecosystem, my answer is I don't know.
It'll probably be good for the price short term.
It might be good for the price medium to longer term, but it might be bad for Bitcoin as a
currency long term based on my question to Eric in that the reason why the government
was actually able to confiscate gold from the people in 1934 was because 80% of that
gold was stored in centralized banks.
All they had to do was tell the banks to turn over people's gold.
They didn't actually have to go to people's homes.
And if that situation repeats, I mean, obviously it's not going to repeat in 2021, 2022.
We are probably talking like 2034, like on the 100th year anniversary of the gold confiscation.
If we do have a Bitcoin ETF and we do have this kind of system where gold is some kind
of a reserve being held by banks like Coinbase, then sure, there could be a giant confiscation.
If the government owns over 51% of all Bitcoin, what can we say about the people's confidence
in Bitcoin?
It could be lost.
And that's all currency is, confidence.
Bruce, do you think people in Wall Street can be trusted with Bitcoin?
Can be trusted.
My belief on people is that everybody, and in this space, it's easy to, there's a lot
of conflict.
And I tend to get along, try and get along with almost everybody.
And I like and respect a lot of people on various sides of this.
I think everybody's sort of, if you recognize that everybody in the world is motivated by
very similar self-interests, and if you recognize that, then you just don't trust anybody,
no matter how much you like them, because they may be compromised.
So I love a lot of people in this space, but I don't trust anybody.
I don't trust anybody on Wall Street either.
A lot of money has been coming in, though, into, yeah, the industry as a whole.
Where do you think that money's coming from?
Where is it going?
What are the people with the hundreds of millions of dollars interested?
Do they still invest in companies?
Have they been completely distracted by the token industry?
There's not a lot.
That's what I did for my job for years and years.
I placed billions and billions of dollars in really high-end private equity funds.
I dealt with sovereign wealth funds.
I worked for the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority and huge private equity firms and
global charities and things like that, placing hundreds of millions into these things.
So I'm very familiar with what those investors are looking at.
And when I first got into this space, my first thought was, oh, great, I'll go to these investors.
But it was way too small.
Now it's starting to get big enough that some of these really large investors are somewhat
interested.
But it's usually like, it's not sovereign wealth funds and huge global pensions.
The real, real serious money is still not looking at this at all.
There's the next tier down family offices, people who have billions, sure, are looking
at this.
But it's still quite small.
And a lot of them have, in my opinion, fairly weak strategies.
Because it's such a new area of technology.
It's so complex.
I think it makes sense to spend, well, what we did with our company, we've never, as a
company, we've actually never sold anything or done anything as a company.
I've done a lot individually.
But as a company, we haven't done anything.
Because I think it makes a lot of sense to spend more time learning.
And I think the mistake with a lot of these, this new wave of sort of second tier, big,
big billionaire investors, is that they're not really taking time to understand the technology.
So they're going after things like ICOs or they're not really looking at it.
I think that's a very, very risky strategy.
How do they engage with it?
Do they put the coins on a treasurer and dump that in a safety vault in Switzerland?
No, I don't think many institutions custody.
And that's an interesting thing that will have to be solved in this.
The issues of custody, and believe me, I get it as a Bitcoiner, I get the whole, you know,
not your keys, not your money and everything.
But at certain points, it does fall apart.
In my opinion, north of $100 million is very, very difficult.
I've managed this kind of money for a long time, I've held Bitcoin.
When you get into higher and higher levels like that, that the institutions need, you
need really advanced systems, and for most of them, they're just not comfortable with
it.
And hopefully, the things that Jameson is working on, other people will make that easier
for them.
But for now, if I were an institution, I would be very tempted to go with a custodian, despite
all the issues with that.
There's a lot more issues, and a lot of these people aren't very technical, there's a lot
of issues with holding your own keys, so that's a big risk.
Yeah, no, that's a big thing.
A lot of people don't think about, and the SEC is going to have the same issue, right?
Like who's going to be the custodian of the Bitcoin ETF, if it's an actual ETF?
The Swedish, the Nordic ETNs got shut down by the SEC because there was miscommunication
in a paperwork that called them an ETF.
An ETF is supposed to be backed, an ETN doesn't have to be backed.
So some paperwork said ETF, some paperwork said ETN, the SEC said that's a mistake, so
they actually shut them down.
And the same thing happens with the funds.
Like a lot of these institutions, sure, they know how to trade, they know how to invest,
but they're not security experts, right?
So what you have is a couple of family offices that have piled into Bitcoin and have been
very vocal about it, right?
You have the Drapers, you have the Novigrad, they've been vocal about it.
There might be a couple of other smaller funds that are willing to take on the challenge
of storing your own Bitcoin, and they're not going to be vocal about it.
You don't know that they exist.
I doubt they would be in such giant positions.
But as far as anyone else, pension funds and all the other money managers, I mean, why
would you want to risk...
They make money as being a metal man.
Like they don't make money by making money.
They make money by slightly beating the S&P 500 and collecting a percent on the money
that they manage.
Why would they risk their entire operation?
Because they stored Bitcoin the wrong way.
It just makes no sense for a big fund to get involved in this.
It's not their business model.
They're probably mostly trading.
How do you see cryptocurrency exchanges being able to engage those traders?
How are they able to fulfill, for example, the regulatory requirements or fulfill the
due diligence requirements of those large funds?
Are funds like directly going to a large exchange and putting their money down?
Well, right.
That's the thing.
There is no clear regulation on this.
So right now, the only option that they have is GBTC pink sheet, which I believe is one
of the worst designed financially traded product in the world, which is one of the reasons
why I think that the SEC needs to make a decision on the CTF, because this monopoly that GBTC
has for investors, for people managing people's retirement accounts, it's just, it's terrible.
It's a terrible option and it's the only option.
So the SEC needs to come up with something just to give it competition so that there's
a real reflection of the price of Bitcoin that someone in a retirement account can put
their money in, not something that, I mean, we all know Bitcoin is volatile, but you also
have a product that is between 25% and 200% volatile on top of Bitcoin's volatility.
And that just makes no sense at all.
So I think that was a huge mistake by the SEC to allow it in the first place.
And now they have to rectify that by creating something more efficient.
Bruce, have you seen large institutional traders going directly to an exchange like Bitfinex
or Bitmex or Binance and putting money down, starting trading for whatever reason?
Yeah, I think some have, and a lot of them have done it through funds.
And I think this will be an evolving process because it's clear now, and I'll talk about
this in my talk tomorrow, that securities are a thing.
They've been a thing for hundreds and hundreds of years.
It's a big, big, big part of global economy.
Anybody interested in the economy should be interested in securities because they're here
to stay.
They're not a fad.
It's not like ICOs.
They're going to come and go.
Securities are a real thing.
And if you represent those with tokens, which we know that some already are, they're just
illegal.
They're not offered.
Some are actually legal.
There's a few legal offerings.
And then we have the writing on the wall from companies like Coinbase, which have announced
that they're going to be licensed in this.
So I think you're going to see a lot more trading, and you'll have a lot more types
of instruments.
You'll have currency and currency-like things.
I don't think there's really many tokens that actually have utility, but there may be a
couple, and then you'll have a whole bunch of securities, I think, which will be all
over the board.
It could be very conservative securities, very risky securities, all kinds of things.
So I think there'll be a lot more trading.
Do these illegal securities make sense?
Are they...
Is it possible to run them in an illegal way without, for example, having the government
shut down the company?
In an illegal way?
Yeah.
Well, a security is basically an agreement.
That's what a security is.
It's an agreement that's tradable.
And that's very, very broad.
Now, the unfortunate thing is that these laws are very, very, very well established.
It's not like Bitcoin, which is a new thing and kind of a gray area.
You can say, okay, we're going to do it over here.
Securities laws in places like the United States and the EU, in the United States, they've
been enforced for 85 years.
They're not going to change.
You can't just say, oh, this is new, we don't follow the laws.
You can be very, very, very clever with some technical ways to make something not a security.
But if you get into where you're exchanging money for something, where the investor has
expectations, it's almost always a security.
So it's going to be hard to avoid those.
But I think that it will be very interesting.
There will be a lot of next generation technologies with smart contracts and things like that
that make new ways of sharing risk and sharing money and participating in profits where people
can work peer to peer where it doesn't need to be a security.
But there's still going to be securities in between.
That's something the regulator has to warm up to, though.
Do you believe this is happening?
Do you believe the regulator is going to warm up to these bearer assets, these bearer securities?
Yeah, I mean, Delaware has already said that they're allowing tokens to be shares, which
is a pretty big deal.
Yeah.
You know what?
I haven't actually heard anything about that in like a year and a half.
I think they were getting some really, I felt, bad advice from people that believed in the
Ethereum blockchain stuff.
And I don't know if that makes total sense.
It really depends on who the advisors are.
It's who the SEC is going to rely on advice.
I mean, when we had that statement from the high level SEC official, and for some reason
people thought that the SEC's view is that Ethereum is not a security, what he actually
said was, in my personal opinion, based on my understanding of what Ethereum is today,
and then he went on and said that he doesn't think Ethereum is a security.
And so that's a huge personal disclaimer, and it's a personal opinion.
And I looked at that statement, based on my understanding of what it is, well, how did
you get that understanding?
Because if different people were in a room with you, you'd have the opposite understanding
of Ethereum's decentralization.
So no one knows, it's a huge wild card.
And there isn't much incentive for Bitcoiners to show up at the SEC and explain why Ethereum
is centralized, but there is lots of incentive from the Ethereum community and similar communities
to Ethereum to explain to the SEC why Ethereum is decentralized, or trustlessness as Matt
nicely explained in the prior presentation.
So we will see what happens.
The lobbying groups are really starting to take off, and it's hard to say whether they'll
win or not, and just because the lobby can do something, we can get stuck with it for
like 10 to 15 years until people realize that was a mistake.
Another thing that's been puzzling me for a while is the topic of stablecoins.
Maybe we'll start with talking about Tether.
Do you believe Tether is much more than a large shadow bank, its own shadow banking
system with exchanges that accept it as collateral and people that trade it peer to peer?
And it's undoubtedly hugely successful.
So maybe we can talk a bit about the copycat stablecoins coming out of Baby Circle, or
who are the others who are building stablecoins?
Gemini.
Do you want me to take it first?
So I mean, Tether is the big elephant in the room, and it's basically, you're right, Tether
has been pretty successful, and because of the success of Tether, a lot of people are
trying to copycat Tether with their own stablecoins.
I don't really understand the fascination with stablecoins at all.
They're just centralized, they're just a US dollar, like the US dollar is a stablecoin,
it's just that you are able, but now you're able to move this US dollar around on a very
technologically unstable and potentially collapsible centralized database, right?
Whether it's Ethereum, whether it's Omni, whether it's the servers of Binance.
I don't even know where the hell they're going to do it.
So you've taken the US dollar, you've put it on top of a centralized platform, basically,
just for the ease of use.
Now, in Tether's specific case, there was lots of questions on whether it's 100% backed
or not.
And again, this goes back to the SEC view, is a Bitcoin backed ETF good or bad for the
crypto ecosystem?
Well, I can make the argument in either direction.
So is Tether fractionally reserved or not?
Is that good or bad for the crypto ecosystem?
Again, I can make the case in both directions.
Because if Tether is fully backed by US dollars in some bank, then why can't the US government
show up in Taiwan and confiscate all of those dollars because they've just claimed that
Tether is being used as a representation of the US dollar illegally, just like they did
with eGold.
And clearly, Taiwan listens to the US government as they just arrested Cody Wilson yesterday
in Taiwan, because that's the rumor of where the money is for Tether.
And that is a big chunk of money.
And now if Tether implodes, which I believe eventually it will, it's inevitable, is that
good or bad for Bitcoin?
I happen to think it's good for Bitcoin because it will be a rush to the computer to turn
that Tether into Bitcoin, right?
So everyone will rush to sell their Tether as soon as possible.
They'll probably get 10, 20 cents on the dollar for it.
And there will be a big entrance into Bitcoin to get rid of your Tether.
But mostly the exchanges, I mean, the exchanges are going to take the hit.
If Tether goes down or other stable coins go down, the exchange is going to get stuck
with it.
I mean, the exchange will just pass on those losses to the consumer, right?
Just like what happened with Bitfinex.
When they got hacked, it didn't matter if you had US dollars or Bitcoin that got hacked.
Everyone took the penalty.
I mean, it is what it is.
We'll deal with it and people will learn how this stuff works.
Yeah, I think the dollar-based, so there's two kinds of stable coins.
There's several kinds of stable coins.
Some people call these things stable coins that aren't really going to be stable because
they don't seem to have an understanding of how economics work and what you would need
to do to make something actually stable.
But if you want to have something, maybe be pegged coin might be a more accurate term.
Pegged to the dollar, that's pretty easy to do if you do what Tether claims they do, which
is they have it backed one-to-one with the dollar.
That's useful in trading because you have, in the investment world already for many years,
we've had money market accounts, which have been a big facilitator of when trades come
in for mutual funds or stocks or bonds or something like that.
It's just very useful for a lot of reasons, which I won't bore you with, why it's useful
for firms to have their own kind of system.
Well, I mean, I can tell you the reason.
Basically, it comes down to the ledger, which we all hopefully understand.
How do you run a ledger?
Who has the ledger of where all the dollars are?
The US government doesn't have a thing to say, yes, those dollars are real, these dollars
aren't.
And if you say you have a money market account at Fidelity, how do you know they really have
it?
Do they back it with proof of reserves, a big vault with some cash somewhere?
Sort of.
But it's kind of complex.
If you facilitate trading and facilitate the moving of Bitcoin and Ethereum and tokens
and eventually securities tokens, it's useful to have that kind of product.
Is that an alternative, though, to, for example, the international wire transfer system?
And it seems to work quite well between cryptocurrency exchanges to move even large positions in
US dollars.
Would that then be an option to pay large bills or move money between countries?
Yeah.
No.
Tether is very good for that.
I know a lot of people are like, oh my God, Bitfinex has just printed another $5 million
worth of Tether.
But why does that happen?
Well, that happens because Bitfinex creates the Tether by moving the money.
And whenever someone wants to move something out of Bitfinex, you all heard about Bitfinex
wire banking problems, right?
So you can either move the Bitcoin out of Bitfinex to another exchange or you move the
Tether out of Bitfinex to another exchange.
So when Bitfinex starts to run out of Tether because their users are moving Tether out,
they need to create more Tether just so that they have it to give people an option to move
the US dollar out of Tether as opposed to moving the Bitcoin out of Tether.
So that's all it really is.
So it is a good option because a lot of these crypto exchanges are having major banking
problems.
So they're getting around those problems by currently using Tether.
But again, it works until it doesn't.
It works until the US government decides to confiscate the underlying dollars, assuming
they exist.
I'm not going to speculate whether Tether is or isn't fractionally reserved.
We'll find out eventually when the US government decides to go and take that money if they
feel like it because they passed a law, we'll find out if the money is there.
Or another thing, or the other way we might find out if there's regulation comes in, right?
That's the same thing.
So to get around the regulation, they're using Tether to move it around.
And again, like I said, it works until it doesn't.
And the other problem is it works as long as the Omnilayer works, right?
Anybody know which developers are working on the Omnilayer?
If there is a bug in the Omnilayer, how quickly will that be solved?
If there is an exploit, how many developers are working on that?
Because that's what Tether is built on top of.
So there is a technological risk there, and there is a regulatory risk there.
The ultimate stable coin, of course.
We keep hearing announcements about it.
We keep hearing about government-issued tokens or government-issued cryptocurrencies.
Is there any substance to this?
If I had to, yeah, judge by what people tell me, it already happened 20 times.
But has any government made significant attempts to go forward with such a proposal?
I think it's really hilarious because the people manufacturing the buggy whips are looking
at the rockets and trying to figure out how to put a license plate on the horse carriage.
They've never faced competition.
In our lifetimes, and in hundreds of years before that, they don't even conceive of what
the real world is like, these people who sit in the fancy offices in these government things
and decide monetary policy.
They have no clue about how the real world works, and they've never competed.
Most of them have never even had a real job.
So to go out in the real world where you have folks like Matt who are out there, are they
going to get somebody like Matt to program, are they going to hire him to program their
fiat coin?
No.
They couldn't possibly do anything that would have any kind of technical usefulness.
And if their goal is to say, hey, let's make really, really good money, you know what they
do?
They'd use Bitcoin.
So they don't want that, though.
They want to say, how can we make something that looks like better money that we can have
power and control?
Just a form of a cargo cult.
Yeah, they don't really want better money.
If they did, they'd objectively look at it and do like their own consumer report and
say, OK, Euro, US dollar, Bitcoin, let's objectively look at these.
And they'd objectively determine what the best is.
But they don't want to do that.
They want to control it.
And that lack of understanding how competition works and this taking this for granted that
because we say it's real, it's real, is a type of arrogance that you would only have
if you had a monopoly on something for 300 years.
You combine that with technical ineptitude and much more fierce competition from a true
open source project like Bitcoin that is out with, as Andrea says, the sewer rats and inoculating
itself against every form of attack.
I just don't see how they have any prayer.
And if they did, what would the properties be?
What would the supply be?
All of these other things.
I think it'll be very, very hard.
It's going to be interesting somewhat, but no more interesting than the fiat dollars.
I mean, certainly nothing close to being as interesting as Bitcoin.
Maybe they'll build it on Ripple.
Yeah.
I mean, I'll throw in a quick comment.
I mean, all governments right now in today's day and age, they're very interested in eliminating
physical cash, right?
So no government wants physical cash in their country.
That's their end goal.
Their end goal is to eliminate physical cash.
Now they will try to get to that goal of eliminate physical cash by any means that they can get
there.
Now, whether they understand cryptocurrencies or not, whether they understand Bitcoin or
not is, I mean, it's good if they do, but it doesn't matter, right?
Because their goal is to eliminate cash.
How are they going to do it?
Well, they're not really interested in something like Bitcoin.
They still want to control the currency, but they want to eliminate physical cash.
So if they can use the right buzzwords and they can get people to use a digital representation
of their currency, they will.
We can talk about why they want to eliminate cash.
I mean, that's pretty simple.
They don't want bank runs, can't have a bank run.
There's nothing to withdraw if there's no cash.
They can set any kind of monetary policy that they like.
I was at a economics conference.
I was listening to Nouriel Roubini talking about a potential negative 10% interest rate
that the bank can impose.
And my question was, no, they can't impose a negative 10% interest rate because of Bitcoin
basically.
If they eliminate cash, if they managed to eliminate cash in 2006, they sure could have
because then you can't exit the system, but not anymore.
And they all think we're tax evaders, so they want to make sure that they collect that upfront.
So those are the reasons they want to eliminate cash.
Now, how are they going to get there?
They can either just eliminate the paper money because 90% of all their money is digital
anyway, and that's the same thing.
Or if they feel that's difficult, they have to come up with a brand new money with all
the right buzzwords saying we are, you know, whatever they're going to say.
We're on the blockchain.
We're on the blockchain.
But in reality, they have no interest in actually using Bitcoin or anything like Bitcoin.
It's still going to be totally centralized.
It won't be like Ripple.
They can adapt Ripple.
There you go.
There's a use case for Ripple.
Yeah, that is a use case for Ripple, actually.
I'm sure you have lots of questions as well.
Maybe you want to quickly raise your hand and shout them out.
Yes, over there.
I think you're going to have to shout.
Why don't you guys come up?
Because we have a mic and I'll hand you the mic.
If anyone else has a question, just like come up or we'll run around.
Hello.
Thanks.
Hi.
So the XBT is still trading in Europe.
It was shut down in the States, the USD quoted XBT.
Do you think the ETN is putting pressure on SEC to approve ETF in the States?
Also, so the Nordic ETFs were only shut down for trading by US people?
Right.
Oh, it's still trading in those currencies.
I mean, look, there is pressure on the SEC in general to start making some decisions
on what is and isn't the security.
There's general pressure.
I think the pressure on figuring out is Ethereum a security or not is the biggest pressure
that they got because that's going to be the, that's like the line.
That's the big one, right?
Is Ethereum a security right now?
Was Ethereum a security in the past?
And what is the metric?
Like for example, if I was brought in to advise the SEC and they said, okay, we know that
Ethereum, we have decided that Ethereum when it launched, Ethereum was a security.
Today it's not a security.
Please help us define when something is no longer a security.
And my answer is that's actually impossible.
Like you don't know, right?
So I think this is the biggest decision they have to make and I have no clue what they're
going to say or how they're going to make it.
I think that's the biggest challenge.
The Bitcoin ETF is probably their second biggest challenge and they have an awesome scapegoat
right now.
We have no control of the underlying exchanges.
We have no control of the underlying price discovery, therefore no ETF until we do.
Once they get a handle on that part, once they're able to regulate the exchanges that
are doing most of the price discovery, then the hurdle is going to be Bitcoin security.
So maybe Jameson Lopp will get a call.
I don't know.
So Brian Bishop is trying to get it, like people at Blockstream, like, and they're going
to advise him that this is very, very difficult.
So they got a couple of challenges ahead of them.
But yeah, the pressure is definitely on because sooner or later, you know, the stature of
limitations will eventually start to pass.
So is an ETF kind of a second layer scaling solution and how does it compare to other
second layers?
It's not a scaling solution at all.
It's just a speculative instrument for people to trade.
I mean, there's nothing relating to transactions.
This is completely off-chain.
Again, it's a double-edged sword, right?
Like I said earlier, those that, you know, look what happened in December, right?
In November, December, when Bitcoin went straight up, blew right through $10,000, went all the
way to 20, just on the speculative expectation that Wall Street is getting in with the futures
market.
Futures market launches, there was no volume.
It was a complete dud.
It meant nothing.
And the price went back down because it never should have hyped that high to begin with.
So the Bitcoin ETF will pretty much do the same thing.
But then it's going to become a tradable instrument.
I know people like to point at gold and how well gold did after the gold ETF came about.
Yeah, but look at gold now.
It's in a, what, seven-year bear market from that high.
And I don't think it's manipulation at all.
It's just that nobody really cares.
So it creates this, you know, on extra expectations that eventually, you know, come back down
to earth.
So I don't think it's going to make that much of a difference.
But I do worry about the concentration of a honeypot of Bitcoin getting growing bigger
and bigger and bigger.
I don't know if you want to add to that.
Hello.
One more here.
I'm just curious.
They say that 90% of gold, the price of gold is speculation.
Where do you think, like, Bitcoin's in circulation?
How much is purely speculation and how much is actually, you know, real usage or whatever
you want to call it?
Well, it's, the value is 100% belief that it's better money and that belief is a form
of speculation.
Otherwise, you'd have no value.
But that's not a negative.
That's just, that's the way value works.
You know, the functionality of Bitcoin isn't what gives us its value because it's trivial
to make a fork.
I could make a fork called Brucecoin.
It would have identical functionality to Bitcoin.
I could run one node, but it wouldn't have any value.
The value only becomes, only comes from the speculation that this will be real money or
is real money or is a better form, a superior form of money.
And the other thing I should qualify in my statement when I was kind of cracking on the
government and their inability to make a better form of money, I absolutely believe that Bitcoin
is a better form of money.
It meets the properties better.
I believe it's better.
But I should also caution and qualify that statement that the best product doesn't always
win.
Look at the market caps right now.
You know, it's surprising how much value the markets has attributed to some of these projects
that don't really have any value.
So the best thing doesn't always win, and the history is littered with examples of the
Tucker and many other things where inferior products has beat superior products.
So just because Bitcoin is the best, we should be very, very cautious to say, you know, everybody
who believes Bitcoin is better money may be right, and it still may not be.
Maybe people don't care because there's a lot of people in the regular world, you talk
about here's a better form of money, it's more durable, more portable, blah, blah, blah.
They don't care.
And they won't really care until everything collapses, and even then they won't really
care.
They blame it on something else.
Whoever the politicians tell them to blame it on, maybe us.
It also works the other way as well.
It also works the other way as well.
Like a hundred other people have created a better Bitcoin, and Bitcoin will still win
just because, even though it's completely inferior, right?
So I can make the argument in the other way as well.
As far as speculation, price discovery is obviously mostly speculation, and it's unfortunate
that only 10 to 50% of money by trading, and the huddling and everyone here holds on Bitcoin.
So that is still a big use case.
So it's both.
The use case is still king, especially if you're storing Bitcoin safely.
Yeah, so Bruce, earlier you said that large conventional institutional players have not
really entered a space yet.
So what will be the tipping point that will make them do that?
What would make the large institutions come in?
Yes.
I think that, well, for one thing, it's what they're comfortable with.
They don't want, all right, so take the Kuwait Investment Authority, for example.
It has $800 billion.
There's hundreds and hundreds of people.
If you think about the math of how you have to manage that money, you have to break it
into pieces of 50 to $100 million commitments minimum, sometimes a couple hundred million.
And if you're going to put a couple hundred million with somebody, you need to meet them
probably four times a year.
You probably want to call them once a month.
You want to get reporting from them.
You're going to want to have a team.
So just do the math.
Just multiply it out.
$800 billion divided by 100 to $200 million commitments times four meetings a year, 10
calls a year, and 10 annual or 10 reports.
Just do the math.
It takes about 1,600 people just to do that.
So when you get into something weird and say, oh, by the way, this doesn't look like anything
else you've ever done.
We don't have limited partnership agreements.
We don't have the due diligence.
You've got to do this weird thing, and we're going to give you this piece of plastic called
a trezor.
They just want to see something they're comfortable with and that they recognize for right or
wrong.
That's just the way they work.
But it gets there.
Some of the more progressive, big pools of money, pensions and things like that, they
start with investing in the funds.
There's hundreds of funds now.
Some of those have allocations from big institutional investors, and the more progressive ones, especially
individuals and family offices and those kind of things, tend to be more progressive.
They're even buying stuff directly.
Thank you very much.
It'll happen.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for your question.
I'll be getting it back to Roman.
So we finally have the correct version of the agenda, the schedule on the screen.
It's identical right now to the one on the website.
Coffee break is going to be 15 minutes because we're really tight on time.
It's over there, guys, and please come back in 15 minutes.
Thank you.
s your introduce, and then you start speaking, people just like that.
Okay.
Break is over.
The next speaker is the organizer of this very conference today, and is the founder
of the cryptocurrency exchange HODL HODL.
Please have Max Kaden to talk about the future of Bitcoin smart contracts.
Hello, everyone.
If you're walking, at least do it like in silence because I'm a bit nervous.
I didn't learn my presentation properly because I was too busy with organizing all the stuff
for you here to come and enjoy the day and the other day and the evening, of course.
So if you had a high expectation for this presentation, I would suggest you to lower
them for upcoming 20 minutes because I will use my notes as well.
I was supposed to speak actually about the traditional VC models and why they don't work
within the Bitcoin industry, but I thought, well, they don't work and nothing changed
from like three months.
So why we should waste our time on VCs because they don't understand the shit about crypto.
So my topic today, and I will sit, is the future of Bitcoin smart contracts.
So smart contracts is basically one of those hype terms or buzzwords that everyone throws
around but not everyone understands actually.
Now I'm sure that you here, the audience here is Bitcoin wise like more sophisticated than
the general public, but anyway, still a problem.
And however, for many people, it's still a question how Bitcoin smart contracts can be
used in the real life and how they can develop in real businesses and in real economy.
So Multisig, which we will be talking about today, is a type of smart contract and it's
nothing new, certainly nothing new.
But however, the world hasn't yet seen the large use cases outside of the crypto.
So today I wanted to talk exactly about that.
And the purpose of the talk is to give out ideas to people who are wondering what to
build on top of the Bitcoin.
Obviously, our company, HODL HODL, is using smart contracts.
However, this talk isn't about our company.
We cannot possibly work on all the various applications of smart contracts actually.
So in fact, we as a business try to inspire and we'll be more than happy than anyone or
as much as more people can build something new and build smart contract solution on top
of the Bitcoin because we don't have much resources and time to do it by ourselves.
So once again, I just wanted to share the ideas.
And afterwards, if you will have any questions, feel free to approach me or Roman as well.
Now let's start with a simple question.
What is smart contract?
And instead of giving you a definition of that, we should use, I think, an example that
we use in our exchange but then can be actually used in various use cases that we will discuss.
So yeah, the classical one, Alice and Bob.
So as you can see on the slide, there are two parties, Alice and Bob.
They both have the keys to release the funds from a special P2SH address, which is essentially
a part of a smart contract arrangement that says that it requires both Alice's and Bob's
keys to release the funds from that escrow.
And this is what's known as multisig because it requires several keys to sign the release
transaction.
So in the essence, this address becomes a multisig escrow account or multisig escrow
address, what do you say?
And it doesn't matter who sends the funds to this escrow, the only thing that matters
whether both parties will release them or who owns the keys.
Yeah, so on our exchange, we use that escrow to allow users to exchange fiat currency and
Bitcoin and back, avoiding holding the Bitcoins in our wallets.
Well, we as exchange hold one key and the seller holds another one.
And it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see how this very same two out of two keys
approach can be used in different business cases outside the crypto.
So for example, suppose you want to rent an apartment, usually your landlord would ask
you for a deposit.
Usually this deposit is held directly by the landlord, which isn't ideal.
So it would be fair if it was locked in multisig escrow and later be returned when both parties
agree on resolution.
Now the same escrow mechanism actually can be applied to freelancers of all the kind.
So basically imagine that you want to hire a developer, especially from another country
to work on your software, you may both agree that you lock in advance for the next two
or three months in escrow.
And another interesting example is that can be applied to creating a Bitcoin equivalent
of future contracts, except that the settlement will be done in Bitcoin, not fiat.
And this would allow for a sort of peer to peer futures where two parties bet on an outcome
and funds that they are bet stored in the multisig address and not within the third
party.
And I think recently in one month there was an accident with BitMEX where the shorts was
closing massively and people were disappointed.
So this type of thing solves that issue because no one can basically affect your future contracts
and your agreements.
Now I could probably continue on and on, but this very simple, very basic two out of two
approach can be used in various use cases outside the crypto.
Now many people, and it's like real life example from our experience, when they hear that how
two out of two escrow works, they come up with a question, but what if one party decides
not to release funds from this escrow account?
So does the money remain locked forever?
And if so, they conclude this won't work.
Now yeah, of course the spheres are mostly unfunded.
You need to consider the following things.
So no party involved in that contract has any intention to lock them forever.
Now different factors, also legal consequences, reputational risk can influence the decision
to unlock the funds.
Sometimes funds that are locked forever can be more beneficial outcome than one of the
person really receiving these funds.
And to be honest, two out of two escrow isn't ideal approach for any business cases or any
scenarios.
You need to consider your market.
You need to consider all the consequences.
You need to consider all other stuff that goes within your business.
Now two out of two multisig is of course a special case of a more general solution called
N out of M multisig, which means that in theory you can have many more parts involved in a
contract with a variable number of keys required to release the funds.
Well to give you a simplified example, consider two out of three.
And our use case with freelancer getting paid for his software.
Suppose he completed the job but the company who hired him isn't satisfied and doesn't
want to release the funds.
Now the third party who is a professional mediator owns the key and he can check in with both
parties and make his decision to sign the transaction that would go in favor of buyer
or in favor of seller or in our case in favor of freelancer and in favor of employer.
Now we actually implemented two out of three multisig and this will be live in upcoming
weeks on our exchange and mainly for large OTC trades but also retail investors and retail
traders can use that as well.
But then there's a more complicated use cases when you require more signatures with different
layers of complexity.
So basically you can have something like five out of 12 multisig which made more sense.
Few words about implementation of these mechanisms.
As I mentioned in the beginning the problem right now is that multisig solutions are not
consumer friendly.
They're mostly used by crypto exchanges to store user funds and an average person or
business would quickly become frustrated trying to figure out how to use multisig in a way
that A, cover your business case and B, doesn't make the brains explode.
One way to go about this to implement everything in the browser that what we use in our products.
So the front end handles key creation storage without sending them to the back end.
Now of course this is not an EDL and prone to certain security issues and to certain
attacks and would be more like secure wise to generate the second key on a smartphone
app or better yet on a specialized device like I don't know maybe Trezor or any other
thing.
And that's how we see actually this will work in the future.
So there will be marketplaces which will offer the simplified solution with front end key
generation and maybe more like sophisticated solution with generation of keys on the stand
alone devices.
Now I want to specifically point out that the multisig isn't something exceptionally
innovative because we have been sort of accused that we're nothing under the sun.
Actually our CTO looks like this most of the time so not only when he literally hears that
also when I'm approaching with new ideas he usually looks like that at me.
Well it's of course true however as I mentioned earlier while multisig has been around long
enough it's anything but the user friendly to be honest.
Well let's say you want to create a contract with someone using two out of two signatures
and basically how many of you know what to do except of selling and buying crypto which
you can do on one platform that exists at the moment.
And actually it's because there's no out of box solution so basically not enough intention
has been paid to that and in turn it's because not many people actually believe multisig
can be used outside of the crypto business but actually it can.
Another problem is just a friendly technology is not enough.
So for example a successful economy requires some marketplaces where people or buyers and
sellers find each other and well we have marketplace that uses this approach which is open bazaar
for products but we for example we don't have any marketplaces for services.
And there's no innovation in multisig and of course it's true but pretty much no one
has actually bothered to bring it all together in a such way that people start using it.
Not for fun or just to point out that bitcoin can be used in various use cases but because
it's actually useful.
Now in the end of my presentation I wanted to use my power as an organizer of this conference
and to make two announcements.
Now first thing we are introducing an OTC trading desk in upcoming weeks for large trades
using the 2 out of 3 multisigs which is safer and we do have this non-custodial approach
which we were developing from the start of our exchange.
Now the second idea which I mentioned that bitcoin futures and we're currently working
on that and it will be released by HODL HODL very soon.
It's a feature that will allow basically people to bet bitcoin on the outcome of certain things
and in other words it's a prediction market.
A future contract will be denominated in bitcoin and it will be done in peer-to-peer manner
so which actually is something that no one has done before as far as I know.
So keep an eye on our Twitter.
We hope that peer-to-peer futures coming your way and we hope that it will give additional
boost to bitcoin economy.
Thank you very much.
Yeah now if you have any questions I need Roma because he's like a technical guy in
our team.
He will look at you with that eye look that I showed you and maybe answer a few questions.
So when you talk about using two of two multi-sig to secure funds, does HODL HODL have in place
some kind of mechanism in case something happens to the company if you're forced to dissolve
for some reason as a centralized entity, would you release your keys?
Or we're like DDoSed or something like that.
We have a plan B for that.
Should I mention this because there's people who are watching this live stream and maybe
they want to do something like that.
It's a bad opsec I think.
But we have plan B of course.
You told about futures platform.
What about Oracle problem?
How you're going to solve that?
Can you repeat once again?
About the futures.
There's a smarter guy.
Just let you know I'm the CTO so if you have any technical questions, could you please
repeat the question?
Yeah the question is if you're planning to introduce futures on your platform, betting
prediction market, I mean on all prediction market the biggest problem is Oracle.
The party who will decide if the event was actually happening it's true.
How you're going to solve that?
So this is solved in a peer-to-peer manner.
So two parties.
Let's say we use two out of two multi-seek which is not going to be the case all the
time but some of the times.
So in that case let's say two parties bet on the fact that the price of Bitcoin is going
to be above 8,000 in a month.
So they should both agree obviously if one person disagrees then the money remains locked
in case we use two out of two multi-seek.
If it's two out of three then essentially the holder of the third key decides who wins.
So there's no particular entity usually that is assigned as an Oracle.
It depends on the type of the contract.
In most cases like even if we use two out of two multi-seek there's no incentive for
the person who lost to not sign the release transaction because he already lost that money.
What he's risking by not signing the release transaction is also losing the reputation
on the exchange and the ability to continue to do trades and futures contracts.
Would all trades be executed on chain?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it'll be a P2SH address smart contract so the funds are locked on this address and
then the release transaction is signed.
So if you become popular enough like Bitmax, do you see any problems?
Bitmax is a day trading platform, right?
We don't claim to want to do that.
So we're just a different, it's a peer-to-peer, it's going to be peer-to-peer futures.
So it's just a different type of trading.
Okay.
Following on the issue that he brought up about the Oracle, so Bitcoin is a global market.
So if you're betting that the price is going to be above or below 8,000 and Bitfinex is
trading at 8,100 and you've got Bitstamp down at say 900 for whatever reason, there's a
valid dispute over what the real price is and furthermore, what if you're looking at
a totally different market outside of US dollar, how is this dispute then resolved in that
the contract should specify which exchange is going to be used, which, you know, all
the other possible conditions.
So it has to be really precise and if it's not precise, we're going to, so before a contract
is created, we would look over the offers that people create on the exchange and if
some of the offers that they create have ambiguous conditions, we would not allow them.
It will be some sort of moderation before contracts are even created.
So what about when you look at the failure of Augur and to get traction of their market,
you're seeming to do a very similar type of approach.
Do you think that's really going to get traction?
We think it's going to get traction because it's a very interesting tool.
But Augur, first of all, it's on Ethereum, right?
Correct.
So they have a slightly different approach to how their oracle works, right?
So they try to be completely decentralized.
We don't claim that.
We're still sort of a centralized entity.
We know for each type of contract, we know who holds the keys and not in the sense that
we know their IDs, but like...
One final point.
How much of this consumer facing UX issue on Bitcoin do you think is a result of limited
scripting abilities and how enabling more scripting would allow for better options in
terms of scaling on that?
So the question is, because Ethereum has more scripting abilities, would it actually enhance
the UI?
Is that a question?
So I think my personal opinion about Ethereum is that it's very, very complex and I personally
don't want to touch it because it's so complex.
Bitcoin is what we're focusing on.
And even with Bitcoin, if you look at our exchange, it's complicated enough.
We have like 10, 20 educational videos that teach people how to use the exchange because
it's complex.
It's a peer-to-peer exchange.
It's inherently complex.
So we try to make it easier, but there's always going to be a wall that you'd be banging against.
So it's an ongoing battle with user interface and simplifying it.
One more question.
Maybe two questions.
Hi.
Thank you.
I had a question about what's the future beyond M of N, especially because Jameson articulated
this very well in one of his articles about how if your M is too small and you lose it,
and then you lose your coins.
And if the N is too big, then they can collude and steal your coins.
So I'm wondering, can we add like H plus M of N, things like this to make it a little
more complex, but a little safer too?
We prefer to take baby steps and not speculate on whether something's going to work or not.
Other people are much better at predicting what's going to work and what theoretically
might be an angle of attack in a certain case.
We currently have two out of two and two out of three.
That's enough for now.
We're just taking baby steps and are trying to see how it goes, right?
It's just adding more keys and participants in a contract, it just complicates things
in terms of UX as well.
So you've got to be careful, you know?
Because the thing is, our multisig library is rather small, but everything that sort
of built on top of it, the UX built on top of it has thousands of lines of code, you
know?
And there's no way around it.
So you've got to be really mindful of adding more complexity to the contracts.
I'm sorry, we can't hear you, please turn the mic on.
My question is somewhat related to the previous question.
Let's say you have five out of 12, as you mentioned, then you have ten mediators, right?
And those ten mediators can collude to steal the funds of the two owners of the contract.
I was thinking, and I'm no Bitcoin script expert, but I think it's doable, you can have
a two out of three with that third key being several keys being combined to one master
key, right?
If you understand my point.
Have you done any thinking or experimenting with weighted keys on Bitcoin?
It's an interesting thing, weight of keys.
No, we haven't experimented with that.
Like I said, it's just we're trying to take baby steps and obviously our goal is to provide
more interesting ways in which people can do business using smart contracts on Bitcoin.
And if that's something that has demand, right now or in the future, we're going to look
at it for sure.
So it's just going to take time.
And adding new features to a multisig library, it's got to be done really carefully because,
you know, one line of code and that can screw us up, it's going to be really, really careful
about that.
But yeah, I mean, if you guys have any ideas about how we can improve our contracts, please
approach me or Max and we're going to discuss that.
And I wanted to say if you have any ideas, and if you want to see that look, then you
can approach Roma.
Thank you very much.
Enjoy your time.
Thank you.
Thanks Max.
Our next speaker would be a Skype session.
So please allow a few minutes for them to set it up.
The person who brought us the beloved Bitcoin standard book that's soon to be translated
to seven languages, Saifuddin Amous is an academic economist living in Beirut and a
professor of economics at the Lebanese American University.
So we're very much looking forward to his talk.
Let's just allow a few minutes again for them to set it up.
I think someone has to dance.
Come on, where's Matt?
You dance.
I'm not an entertainer.
Hello?
Can we have a round of applause for Saifuddin, please?
Yeah, let's have a round of applause for Saifuddin.
Hello, can everyone hear me?
Okay, wonderful.
But don't you...
You can't see my slides, can you?
You got to share the screen if you want them to see your slides.
How do I do that?
Where is that?
This is new Skype, I'm sorry.
Is that working?
Yeah, it does.
Yeah, it does.
Okay, wonderful.
Thank you so much, everybody, for inviting me to speak today.
It would have been really great to join you, but unfortunately I couldn't make it.
The title of my talk today is The Bitcoin Standard as a Scaling Solution.
And what I'm going to describe is how I see Bitcoin scaling and what this means for Bitcoin
security and for the role of government and its intervention into Bitcoin.
So it's going to be a little bit different from my usual talk, so I'm going to skip a
lot of the content that is in my book.
And if you're interested in learning more about it, I would recommend that you pick
up the book, but I'll have to skip large parts.
So first of all, the main concept of my book is about the hardness of money.
So I'm going to just very briefly describe what I mean by hard money.
And that pretty much always, whenever humans have used something as money, it is always
hard to produce.
And so we can see this is the case with cattle, with seashells, and anytime something that
is hard to produce is interacting with something that is not hard to produce, the thing that
is harder to produce ends up remaining as money.
Because the things that are easy to produce fall into what I call the easy money trap
and that it just becomes very easy to produce more and more of them, and therefore the value
of them shrinks.
And so anybody who stores value in them will end up having little value left in the future.
So Bitcoin is interesting for me because it is the hardest money that we've ever invented
as humanity.
It is the one thing whose supply is the most reliably scarce.
Some things might happen that could change the Bitcoin supply, like yesterday's bug,
for instance.
But I would say the chances of that happening are far less than, say, the US dollar supply
changing or any of these other competitors to Bitcoin changing their supply.
So the interesting thing about Bitcoin is that no matter how much people demand it,
it doesn't make more of it.
There's no way to make more of it.
There's no way to increase the supply.
What happens is that the production of Bitcoin gets harder.
In other words, the mining becomes more expensive, which makes it even more secure.
So the important thing here is that we've seen in history, and I discuss this depth
in my book, money is a winner-take-all market.
Demand for a store of value is a winner-take-all.
And people like to bring up the example of silver, particularly altcoiners.
They like to talk about how there was gold and there was silver.
But really, silver was only around once there was a use for it for small transactions, which
is when gold coins and silver coins were being used.
But once payments became denominated in instruments backed by physical gold or physical silver,
there was no room for silver.
And demand for silver crashed, and the price of it hasn't recovered since the 1870s.
So I think in general, we have to keep this in mind that hard money is not a niche little
good that can remain.
Some people make the analogy of Bitcoin being like Esperanto, in that it will always remain
a niche language.
But I think that's not going to really be valid, because there's no need for somebody
to learn an extra language like Esperanto, or at least the need for it is far less pressing
than the need for people to move from an easy money to a harder money.
Hard money is not going to be like Esperanto, where it can remain on the fringe.
I think it's going toรนthe demand for it is going to be enormous, and it's going to
be overwhelming.
And so the limitation is not going to be in terms ofรนthe limitation on how much demand
there is is not going to be limited, I think.
It's a winner-take-all market in the end of the day.
And even if people don't move towards Bitcoin, you know, their wealth will continue to drop
while the wealth of people who hold Bitcoin will continue to rise.
So I'm not trying to sell Bitcoin here, I'm just trying to say that the economic reality
of it means that this is likely to continue over time.
And you know, there will be crashes, and it might crash a lot, and it might drop, but
I think in many decades from now, we're going to see Bitcoin continue to attract more and
more wealth.
So what is the limit, then, on Bitcoin scaling?
Well, the Bitcoin is on-chainรนthe limit is in on-chain scaling.
And you know, the mostรนthe highest capacity that we've seen Bitcoin perform regularly
was about 500,000 transactions per day, that we've seen them perform safely and regularly.
That's obviously nowhere near enough for everybody in the world to be using it.
And you know, there are many optimizations of block space that can be done to allow people
to have blockchain transactions or payments more accurately.
And you know, you can use many, many different ways of optimizing on-chain scaling, but there
is an absolute minimum for a payment size which is 34 bytes.
You know, no matter how many kind of optimizations with CoinJoin, for instance, you make, you
run against this hard limit.
And obviously, I think that, you know, the limit for each payment size is likely going
to be larger.
But this is a very strong limit, which is that you can't make a payment for less than
34 bytes.
So if you assume that we have something like two megabyte blocks, which is what we have
right now, over 34 bytes per transaction, we have something like eight and a half million
transactions per day.
And that, I think, is nowhere near enough for the whole world to perform on-chain transactions.
So in other words, if Bitcoin continues to refuse to die and demand for it continues
to increase, there's no way that everybody's going to be using on-chain transaction.
And I think this is something that has become clear to pretty much everybody except for
big cashers.
And so, you know, and the problem, of course, is that if we try to scale it in terms of
increasing the block size, then you can't realistically solve this problem without raising
the cost of running a node and essentially ruining the decentralization of the network.
So this is similar to the situation of gold at the end of the 19th century.
Everybody wants to hold it.
Everybody wants to use it as a store of value because it is the hardest money.
But transaction costs are too high.
It's not convenient to go around cutting up gold coins and combining them and melting
them all the time.
And so the solution with gold was the gold standard, wherein the gold rarely moved, but
financial instruments backed by the gold were the ones that were moving.
In other words, each movement of physical gold was a settlement payment usually for
thousands of individual payments taking place with, say, pieces of paper or credit notes
or bills of exchange that were backed by gold.
And this is we see something similar emerging with Bitcoin today.
You know, if you look at exchanges or casinos or betting services that use Bitcoin, they
move far more Bitcoin off chain than they do on chain, particularly casinos and betting
services.
You know, you send them the money once and then you're gambling.
And with every payment that takes place on the platform, it doesn't get registered on
the Bitcoin blockchain because the Bitcoin blockchain is too expensive.
Remember, at the beginning, Satoshi Dice, for instance, used to do that because block
space was not scarce at the earlier years.
Now it's becoming scarcer.
And so these companies are learning to take these transactions off of the chain.
And many of these transactions, you know, you're trusting the casino anyway.
So it's not like them resorting to an off chain transaction is going to reduce your
security because you're sending them your money anyway.
It's just moving it from one bet to the other.
Lightning is another example of how scaling is happening, where, you know, you're transacting
with Bitcoin as a unit of account, just like you with a gold standard, you're transacting
with gold, although the gold itself or the Bitcoin itself is not actually moving.
It's in the channel or locked up in the bank.
And OpenDime is another example of physical scaling and then multisig solutions and custody
solutions with multisig.
All of these are emerging as ways to get around these limitations of scaling.
In other words, we already see that even today, when Bitcoin has not taken over the world,
the majority of Bitcoin transactions arguably do not happen on the Bitcoin block chain.
They're set at off chain by payment processors, exchanges and websites that utilize Bitcoin.
So in a sense, we see this Bitcoin standard beginning to already emerge.
Over time, we'd expect that Bitcoin on chain transactions can increase, but only marginally.
But off chain transactions can increase exponentially.
As the liquidity and people willing to accept Bitcoin increases, I think we're seeing a
new global alternative financial system begin to develop around Bitcoin.
So the question then becomes, is this going to face gold's fate?
Well, we've seen how that worked out for gold.
Gold is now about a sixth of it is controlled by central banks around the world.
And the market for gold around the world is not allowed to assume a monetary role.
And government money has sort of replaced it.
It's possible.
It's definitely possible.
And this is a security risk that Bitcoin faces.
However, I think we can only really appreciate Bitcoin's value proposition and Bitcoin's
security advantage and Bitcoin's technological breakthrough as being better able to resist
that threat.
That's really it.
And if you think about it, and that's because of decentralization and you know, just like
when we discuss decentralization of Bitcoin or other blockchains, we talk about the cost
of running a node, we can think of the decentralization of Bitcoin versus gold as being fundamentally
about the cost of running a full node under the gold standard in order to run a full node
under the gold standard.
In other words, to use to be able to perform final settlement of physical gold, to move
it from your bank to somebody else's bank, you know, you needed to own a gold bank.
And that is extremely expensive.
And moving gold around, shipping it, securing it, insuring it is always very high.
And so you remember the story a few years ago when Germany asked for some of its gold
repatriated back from the US, it cost many millions of dollars to move it and many years
to move it around.
And so this, I think you cannot discuss the failure of the gold standard without understanding
this as being the Achilles heel of the gold standard.
Because the high cost of settlement, in other words, the high cost of running a full node
on Bitcoin is what made, sorry, on gold, is what made gold banking centralized.
And so eventually we started seeing that, you know, within a city we started to have
a citywide bank and then a nationwide central bank and then a few central banks all over
the world.
And effectively, you know, we only have one central bank in the world.
If you want to think of the US dollar monetary system in Bitcoin terms, there's only one
full node.
And that's the US Federal Reserve, because you can't move money anywhere around the world
without effectively the US Federal Reserve having the ability to censor you through the
traditional financial system.
So I think that centralization is a product of gold's expensive clearance, is the product
of how expensive it is to move gold.
And so with Bitcoin, you know, the advantage that Bitcoin offers is the transaction costs
are much lower.
So even if the transaction costs rise by 1000 fold over what they are today, it's still
far, far cheaper to move, say, a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin than it is to move a billion
dollars worth of gold.
And it could multiply the transaction costs in Bitcoin by 10,000 or 100,000, and they'll
still be far cheaper, which means that a Bitcoin standard is going to be far more decentralized
than a gold standard.
In other words, the cost of running a Bitcoin full node is far lower than the cost of running
a gold full node.
So it's being more decentralized, being digital, and not needing any physical infrastructure
that is essential for it.
It's going to be far, far harder for governments to confiscate Bitcoin than they did with gold.
And I think here a very important point is that some people, particularly one of the
earlier speaker, likes to talk about the gold standard as being a form of fiat.
But it's important to understand that governments were only able to issue fiat money after they
confiscated gold.
This is something that is not talked about a lot, but I talk about it in my book.
In the 1920s and 30s, most of the world's industrial economies, their governments confiscated
their people's gold.
And it was very easy to confiscate it because it was all centralized in the few full nodes
of the small banks, of the small number of banks that were able to hold the majority
of the gold reserves.
That made it much easier to confiscate.
So after that confiscation, that was the only time when governments were able to issue money
that was unbacked by gold because they controlled the majority of the gold.
In other words, their people weren't able to create a market in gold and to give gold
the liquidity that would be necessary for it to be a monetary instrument.
And so I think that makes me lean towards the fact that creating fiat monies over Bitcoin
that are not 100% backed by Bitcoin, I think, is going to be a failed experiment, and banks
or governments that try it will fail.
And fractional reserve banking, I think, will also be highly unstable over Bitcoin because
it was unstable over gold, and it was only allowed to continue after the gold standard
was suspended.
Finally, will this- and many people confuse what I'm saying as- or confuse my book for
being a call for governments to start buying central- for governments and central banks
to start buying gold.
And I think this is a big misconception, and I don't think this is the reality.
In fact, you know, the subtitle of my book says Bitcoin is the decentralized alternative
to central banking.
So I genuinely- and the more I think about it, the less I think it is likely that governments
will adopt Bitcoin or central banks will hold it as an asset.
And for these main four reasons that I mentioned, the mental models of central bankers- central
bankers are the last people that will get Bitcoin because they're completely inculcated
in the kind of Keynesian economics that Bitcoin is built to fight.
And so they're not always going- they're not going to like it.
They don't like the concept of hard money, and they don't like the discipline that hard
money enforces on them and on their governments, and, you know, they like to keep the senior
edge.
The senior edge is essential for most governments around the world today.
And finally, U.S. power is likely going to act against any government, because governments
are centralized.
And so they would be likely to, you know, not want to resist economic and political
pressure from the U.S. to avoid this.
So I don't really see this emerging as a central bank asset.
And I think what Bitcoin is going to do is that it's going to grow as an alternative
to central banking, because it is today- it is the only viable alternative to central
banking.
In other words, if I wanted to send money from here to China today, the only way that
I could send the money is either through the central banking systems of both countries,
going through the U.S. Federal Reserve or through Bitcoin.
So we're going to see a financial system being built around Bitcoin, backed by Bitcoin
transactions.
And I think it's going to be largely free of government intervention in terms of government
trying to take part of it.
Will governments fight it?
That I think is a question I can't answer.
But will they succeed in it is another question I can't answer, obviously.
Only time will tell.
But I think Bitcoin's unique value proposition, Bitcoin's unique breakthrough is that it is
a far stronger technology for resisting the encroachment of government on money than gold
under the gold standard.
That is it for me.
Thank you very much.
Hey guys, if you have any questions, I'm sure you have them.
Please raise your hand.
And Saifedean, could you please switch back to the video so people can see you?
Yes.
Thank you.
Okay.
Hello, my name is Dmitry, I'm from St. Petersburg, Russia.
First of all, Saifedean, thanks for the great book you wrote.
I did enjoy reading it.
Could you please, I have a question regarding the winner takes it all that you mentioned.
What are the forces that push, that makes all the ecosystem gravitate to one single
decentralized coin?
What makes the Bitcoin to have this nice, big stock to flow ratio that you mentioned
in your book?
Thank you.
So I think it's important to understand this is not something that you can just code into
or program into your coin and expect it to just work exactly like it works with Bitcoin.
This is a function of the fact that Bitcoin is very, very hard to change.
Or more accurately, it's a function of the fact that you run your own node.
And if you want to keep the 21 million supply, you can keep it and nobody else can convince
you to change it.
And so there's no mechanism for somebody to force your node to adopt an inflationary schedule.
And so this, I think, is how Bitcoin is different from all the other coins, which essentially
all have single points of failure.
Essentially all have creators that have worked to produce them, to market them and essentially
have a big investment in them and have an outsize influence on them.
So this is one aspect of it in technical terms.
But I think the monetary aspect of it is simply that there's just really no reason for having
a second money.
In other words, whenever there are two monies, one is more liquid than the other, everybody
will prefer to go with the one that is the most liquid rather than the one that is the
least liquid.
And this is just going to tend towards being a market where one winner takes all.
And historically, whenever we've had several monies coexist, it was one of two things.
It was either that the money itself was very bulky and hard to move around and hard to
use for payments, such as, say, gold and which isn't easy to cut up and combine, or it was
enforced by governments.
So similar to what we have today, people look around the world and say we have hundreds
of government currencies.
But that's not a market outcome.
If we had a free market like we did up to a point in the 19th century, all the world
shifted towards the gold standard by the end of the 19th century, not because governments
forced them, but governments were forced to accept it.
And the governments that rejected moving to gold, or the governments that waited a long
time to move to gold, ended up being the one paying a very heavy price from this.
Hi, my name is Alex.
So the general rule is that rich people get richer and poor people get poorer.
When you look at the list of the Bitcoin addresses, the biggest addresses belong to exchanges.
So my question is, like, why, for example, exchanges are better than governments?
And how do you see a more fair distribution of Bitcoin in the society with major exchanges
being the biggest holders and with all the risks associated with that?
I think the only fair distribution of Bitcoin or any other form of money is one in which
the only way to obtain it is legitimately.
In other words, either somebody pays it for you or you make it yourself at the market
cost.
And the market cost, and that's why hard money is important, because hard money costs about
as much to make as its market value.
That's what makes it hard money.
So the cost for the US government to create a million dollars today is nowhere near a
million dollars.
But the cost for you to mine, say, a million dollars worth of gold is roughly around a
million dollars worth of gold, and the same is true in the case of Bitcoin.
So for me, as long as the supply can only be obtained legitimately and can only be printed
at a very high cost or can only be created at the cost of the instrument on the market,
then that is the legitimate distribution.
For me, I don't see the issues of distribution in terms of quantity as being a valid concern
for anybody.
I don't think it's a valid field of inquiry in economics, and I think it's absolutely
counterproductive to be thinking in terms of comparing toy stocks.
It's the sort of thing that you would expect children to do and not your children.
But past the age of five or six, people don't care about it.
People shouldn't be concerned with how much other people have as toys.
They should be concerned about taking care of their own toys.
So Bitcoin, as long as it stops others from taking away your money, your hard earned money,
or a lot stops others from taking away the value of your money, then that distribution
is fair for me.
Yes, I have a question.
The past week there has been discussion on Twitter if gold is a mean reverting good or
not and you refute this theory and it would also implicate if this theory was true that
in the long run Bitcoin volatility would be a little bit higher than gold volatility.
Could you please elaborate why you refute that gold is a mean reverting good?
I'm not sure if I've even seen that discussion or have heard that term.
I don't understand.
What do you mean by mean reverting good?
There is this theory going around that when gold price rises, more gold mines will open
and that will drop the price of gold.
And when gold price drops a lot, then the reverse happens.
And this is a theory that it would stabilize gold prices, but a lot of people on Twitter
refute that this is a stabilizing effect.
Yes, okay.
Yeah, I think in my book I argue about this, I think a lot of people in the gold industry
also understand and say this, that the output of gold mines is practically inconsequential
to the determination of gold prices.
And that's why gold is good as money because you look at the prices, you know, when the
price rises for gold very quickly, like say in the 1970s or like about 10 years ago when
it rose very quickly, it's you look at the mining supply afterwards and you see it's
not reacting.
It's not, you know, if gold price doubles in a year, gold mining output can't double.
It can only increase one or two percent, maybe something in that range that's about it.
So the output is highly uncertain because it depends on the success of digging missions
and expeditions and people digging into the ground.
And that's a crap shoot.
And so it's not really responsive to price.
What is responsive to price in the case of gold is holder's demand, is people who hold
gold and buy it and sell it as a store of value.
And that responds to price.
And that's why essentially in a monetary good, you want the good to not be sensitive to demand
and supply fluctuation, sorry, to supply fluctuations so that the demand and the supply all comes
from the market and its use as a medium exchange or as a store of value, which is what the
cases with with say Bitcoin would be.
In other words, many people say that, you know, because of gold mining, gold is a better
out money because it will always increase at one or two percent.
But actually, even if you read Mises, Mises says that, you know, gold's mining output
is a hindrance to its playing its monetary role.
But it's precisely money because it's not very significant.
In other words, with any other metal, the market for the metal will be far more affected
by the mining output than the cases with gold.
And so Bitcoin even improves on that, in my opinion.
Hi.
My name is Massimo.
Every time I think about a switch towards a Bitcoin standard, so the alternative, the
only way I can see is some sort of revolution, quite literal revolution.
And obviously that is extremely scary because the magnitude of the fall would be would be
huge in in in Western societies, societies, especially.
Do you see a nonviolent scenario where this transition could happen?
Yeah, actually, I think, you know, the more that I think about it, the more I realize
this doesn't have to be a Weimar Republic style of collapse.
In fact, it's more likely that it's going to look like a dollarization.
So when you think about when, say, Ecuador or Seychelles moved from using their own currency
that was collapsing towards the dollar.
So while their currency was collapsing, their economy was in bad trouble.
But as soon as they moved to the dollar, things improved.
And this is why why it's different from the Weimar scenario or from Zimbabwe or from Venezuela.
And Venezuela and Zimbabwe, the collapse of the currency means people no longer have a
medium of exchange.
They no longer have a store of value.
They no longer have something that they can use to exchange with one another and and have
an actual functioning economy.
But when people are shifting towards the dollar, you know, once you dump your Zimbabwean dollars
and you move to the U.S. dollar or from the Ecuadorian peso to the U.S. dollar, once you
dump it and move to it, you're not left without the money.
You've moved to a new, harder monetary system with a better monetary system.
And so, you know, I think it's not going to necessarily be a situation where the people
who lose are hurt because the people who benefit will be benefiting a lot.
And it's open for anybody who realizes what is going on to jump ship and join on board.
And so it might not be this terrible collapse, because, you know, it might happen gradually
and it might just be the fading to irrelevance of government money and their government-based
economies.
It doesn't necessarily have to be bloody and it doesn't have to be terrible, because I
think, you know, it's a better alternative.
People are not moving back to barter as the situation in the Weimar Republic.
People are moving forward to a more advanced, digital, harder form of money.
Okay, last question.
Do you think, I mean, you're saying that the problem of gold is that it's very costly to
move, right?
So what do you think will happen when all the Bitcoins are mined?
And could it be that Bitcoin will face the fate of gold, because it will be very expensive
to move Bitcoin, since there will be no miners and only transaction costs?
Yeah, it will be very expensive to move Bitcoin.
I think there's no escaping that Bitcoin transactions on chain have to be expensive.
They will be expensive.
They're going to get much more expensive, in my opinion.
However, you know, in order to get to the point where they become as expensive as gold,
you know, we need to be talking about, think about how much it costs you to move one billion
dollars of gold today, say, from Washington, D.C., to, say, Tokyo.
How much it would cost to move that in terms of gold?
Now, think about Bitcoin.
As long as Bitcoin is cheaper than that, it's got a major operational advantage on gold
and it's got a major security advantage over gold that makes it far harder for governments
to capture.
This is really my theory in a nutshell.
Why I think, why I'm very interested in Bitcoin, because it's a better shot at doing what gold
should or could have done.
OK, let's give a huge round of applause.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
OK, here we go.
OK, we're going to have two more sessions before the lunch break.
I know it's difficult, but just hold on, guys.
OK.
Just two minutes break, we'll set it up and don't go anywhere.

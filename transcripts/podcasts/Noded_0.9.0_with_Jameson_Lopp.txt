Today's episode is dedicated to my first son, Alexander Samuel Rochard. He was
born on February 12th 2018 at 9.08 p.m. 7 pounds 19.2 inches.
Welcome to the Noted podcast. This is episode 0.9.0 and today I'm joined with
Jameson Lopp. Unfortunately our co-host Michael Goldstein was not able to make
it today. And Jameson, how are you? Not bad. Been keeping pretty busy. I spent
most of this week actually at Satoshi Roundtable. Fantastic. And usually I start
these interviews by going into the beginning like when you first got into
Bitcoin. But I actually want to start with the opposite now which because I
just saw that you had tweeted out about a new rig that you've got and you were
able to sync your full node and how long was it? I believe it was 152 minutes.
That's astounding because I think that I now granted I've never messed with
increasing the DB cache but just like on my own computer I think when I did it it
took me a few days at least. So at this point what would you say is
the bottleneck? Yeah so you know I was testing a few things. Now it's important
to note that like I'm on gigabit fiber so a lot of people might be bottlenecked
by their bandwidth and their ISP. I am not really bottled by that anymore. It's
probably the the CPU and the actual disk storage that are going to be the
bottleneck. So I maxed out and got like a new six core i7 CPU but I think the
more important thing is that I got one of those NVMe you know like pure RAM
solid-state drives that are like 10,000 IOPS per second or maybe a 100,000 I
don't even know but they're screaming fast. So I think that plus jacking up the
DB cache I put 32 gigs of RAM in it and jacked up the DB cache to like 24 gigs
but even once you get all the way through the whole sync it's only using
maybe around 12 or 13 gigs. So that's I think about as fast as you can probably
sync on consumer hardware right now. And what is it storing in the RAM when it's
doing that initial sync? Should be pretty much just the UTXO set so you know that's
what pretty much all of the the database intensive write operations are just you
know deleting UTXOs as they get spent and adding new ones. Gotcha and so I
think that the you know this is the noted podcast so obviously this subject
is very apropos and one of the contentions we saw last year with the
scaling debate is on the subject of the initial sync time for nodes and that the
fact that technology is advancing so quickly that really we should be
increasing the block size limit to keep up with these advances in technology and
what you're presenting to us here is a solid case in that direction. Kind of.
This is the you know optimal best case scenario and so I'm fortunate to live in
an area with gigabit speed internet and I you know have the financial ability to
buy a $2,500 computer but you know on the the exact opposite end of that there's
gonna be people who are still on pretty slow broadband and are not gonna be able
to afford anything much more than like a mobile phone or Raspberry Pi so I run
both and the the Raspberry Pi nodes are struggling right now so it's good to
you know get a better idea of the entire spectrum. Right and it's interesting that
I mean you got a cutting-edge rig for $2,500 I think we we heard some people
saying that you would need to spend ten thousand dollars on a rig for having
your gigabyte blocks it's unclear to me where that ten thousand dollars is going.
Well and then the other thing is when when people say stuff like that most of
the time they're talking about what would be required to stay synced at the
tip of the blockchain they don't think at all about the initial sync time of
what happens once you have a year worth of gigabyte blocks like it's gonna take
you a long time to chew through that even if you have you know crazy like
industrial server that cost you a hundred thousand dollars and uses you
know highly parallelized CPUs and disks and everything so. Maybe the vision is
like Amazon has a service where they ship via shipping container all of the
data rather than over the public internet so maybe that's the vision for
spinning up a new node is that you get a container delivered. Oh yeah I mean if you
want to get really creative any sort of transportation mechanism for data is
possible here it doesn't have to be over the internet and in some cases it is
faster to ship via truck or I think that like Google had like a carrier pigeon
parody thing they were doing or they were showing like how much bandwidth you
could get like strap a USB stick to a carrier pigeon or something so you can
get pretty creative with it you can even set up a satellite and beam it down from
space if you want. That's right all right so let's rewind and I think that we've
known each other on Twitter since like 2013 and this is our first time talking
with each other we haven't met in person yet I'm sure we will at some point but
yeah so did you initially get into Bitcoin in 2013 or before then? It was
like summer fall of 2012. Okay and what initially like were you interested in
it from the libertarian angle or the technology angle what attracted you to
Bitcoin? It was about 50-50 on the libertarian philosophy and computer
science stuff and you know I'm sure that I had heard of it a few times before
then and just dismissed it and for some reason I think it was a Slashdot article
I realized oh this thing keeps coming back and so I started looking into it
more and read the white paper and realized that like it was just a very
different system from anything I'd ever seen before and that it was pretty
elegant in the way it was designed so that was kind of what hooked me and got
me started running nodes and you know sending my first wire transfer to MT
Gox and eventually led to forking Bitcoin core creating Satoshi and you
know trying to offer operational insights to the developers with that.
Yeah you want to get into Satoshi because I think it's a really interesting
project and and shows how much one developer can can do in this space. Yeah
well and I think it's interesting because I don't really spend much time
on it you know I maybe spent a few dozen probably less than a hundred hours total
on it and most of that was in those first few months where I was just trying
to figure out how Bitcoin core worked. So Satoshi is pretty simple from a
technical standpoint it's Bitcoin core plus about 500 lines of instrumentation
code and a few hundred of those are the actual stats D library and then the rest
is just scattered throughout the code base whenever an interesting event
happens maybe a transaction comes in a block comes in a peer to peer message
comes in or goes out tracking all of the different events and activities within
the node then I just emit some statistics to stats D which is a local
daemon that runs and aggregates all of those stats up and then those get stored
in database that is hooked up to a very pretty Grafana dashboard on Satoshi.info
so you get some nice eye candy and basically the idea was that you know
Bitcoin crypto assets it's all about openness and transparency and while the
code was very open and a lot of the other metrics of like the the network
itself like the coins and whatnot were were fairly transparent through other
block explorers and other projects the actual internal operations of the nodes
and what they were doing was very opaque and so I wanted to understand it better
I figured that other developers also wanted to understand it better and I
think it's been fairly successful because a number of Bitcoin developers
over the years have referenced stats and graphs from Satoshi and I think it's
helped them make more informed decisions about what needs to be done to the nodes
it's interesting to me that you mentioned that it's taken up so little
of your time to maintain because like once you set up a piece of software
correctly oftentimes you can just let it run and it'll keep doing its thing for a
long time but the challenge that like I would imagine in this case is if this is
a patch set on top of Bitcoin core and they are constantly refactoring the
underlying code has it been a challenge to keep up with that and rebase
essentially yes that is where the majority of my time comes in I haven't
really been spending a lot of time you know trying to add more metrics recently
unless someone comes to me and says hey we really need to have this and it's
easy for me to figure out because quite honestly I'm not a C++ developer
before I started tinkering with Bitcoin core I hadn't done any C++ development
in ten years you know since I was in college and even today very rusty on it
so it's still a bit of a pain for me to get in there and make changes and then
you know allow them to actually compile and get the test to pass but yeah I
would say you know each major release that comes out I merge all of the
changes since the last release and you know sometimes it takes me an hour to
fix those conflicts sometimes it takes me an entire afternoon I think for the
point 15 release it was more like an entire afternoon because they've been
refactoring so much and like splitting out the main dot CPP file and moving
just code around to make it more modular that it was a real pain so you know from
that standpoint like if you want to talk about like altcoins and their
maintainability you can go out there and look like the vast majority of altcoins
are pretty much stuck at the point where they forked off years ago unless they
have a very experienced maintainer who stays on top of it and keeps pulling
those changes down and of course the more changes you make locally the harder
it becomes as those code bases diverge right and so really though if if these
altcoins had their consensus critical code that was what differentiated them
from Bitcoin in an isolated manner then they could much more easily keep up but
that would also prevent them from making their own changes that really like
what's the point of having an altcoin if you're going if you're not going to make
your own architectural changes or whatever adding features like Zcash does
which involves touching a lot of different parts of the code base and
making those merge conflicts increasingly challenging to reconcile so
then the other let's see I lost my train of thought oh I wanted to get into your
your background as you said that you weren't very familiar with C++ so what
was your development background before getting into the wild world of Bitcoin
so I've been a web developer of sorts ever since I got out of college and I
really started more on the front end with design HTML C++ JavaScript type
of stuff more user-facing and over the years moved further and further back so
after a couple years I started doing more lamp stack development and then a
few years after that moved even further back into doing cloud computing like
large data scale processing with Hadoop clusters and other highly parallelized
type of software because I was working for email marketing company that was
sending out a hundred million emails a day and then ingesting just a ton of
analytics that you know the customers wanted to get analyzed in as close to
real-time as possible and it it was never really a passion of mine but it
provided a lot of interesting technical scaling challenges and so that led to me
to be a primarily Java developer and then once I went full-time at BitGo
three years ago I was lucky enough that their infrastructure indexing services
were also Java and Bitcoin J based and so I've pretty much stuck to Java for
the past three years as well they'll also been doing a bit of Node.js and a
little bit of Go. Awesome so you mentioned you joined BitGo three years
ago and do you want to describe like what BitGo does and what the vision for
the company is in broad terms? Yeah so BitGo doesn't get a ton of press or
recognition in the sort of mainstream consumer crypto space and that's because
we're really an enterprise focused company so our our customers tend to be
large services that have to operate hot wallets so that tends to be exchanges
and payment processors and anyone who is receiving or sending fairly
significant volumes of crypto that have to be automated because security of
course is one of the top concerns in this space if you screw up there's nobody
to save you and if you need the ultimate security it's very simple you just take
all your private keys and take them off the internet you've got your cold
storage so you've now pulled all of your security concerns into the realm of
physical security which is a fairly well understood problem but if you have to
have automated withdrawals then you've got a hot wallet that is running code
somewhere on the internet that some hacker could potentially get into and
screw with the code and cause you to automatically send a transaction to them
and now all your money is gone so the way that BitGo operates we provide a
multi-signature security model where instead of just having a single private
key on your computer that's signing the transactions there's instead three
different keys and you have one key on your server BitGo has one key on our
servers and then you keep a third key either stored offline yourself or stored
offline with another third party which is basically a recovery mechanism now
when you want to make a transaction you're gonna create the transaction and
half sign it on your end and then send it to BitGo and BitGo will have to look
at all of your recent activity look at various security policies that we've
set up that you set up and decide whether or not to co-sign that
transaction and until we co-sign the transaction it's not valid because all
of the wallets are two out of three multi-sig so if anything is wrong then
all we do is nothing and we alert the user and say hey you need to go check
your wallet you might have a policy violation but if everything's fine we
co-sign it it becomes a valid transaction and we broadcast it out onto
the network and hopefully it gets confirmed in a timely manner if our fee
estimation and UTXO selection and all the other stuff worked out well
fascinating and so does does a BitGo customer they have their UTXOs are
essentially segregated right it's not like yeah Coinbase where all you know
it's kind of a layer above yeah so BitGo is non-custodial so each time someone
creates a wallet they have their own UTXO set for that wallet and nobody can
mess with those UTXOs unless you know you use two out of the three private
keys in that setup and it's it's an interesting model from a regulatory
perspective as well because it means that we're not a financial services
provider we are just a software service provider and it's also interesting in
the sense that if a hacker gets into the user's computer then there's not enough
private key data for them to steal the money if a hacker gets into BitGo
servers there's not enough private key data for them to steal from our users
and even better if BitGo ceases to exist for any reason you don't lose anything
you just go get your recovery key and we have open source software that you can
use to create a transaction without ever talking to our servers so you can just
route around us and does this use the standard Bitcoin networks multi-sig
feature or is this something else yeah this is a two out of three P2SH and so
that's interesting because essentially the the customer is not custodial you
know assuming that their backup is put away and you're not and I think that it's
funny because it just reminds me of the Bitcoin network in terms of
decentralization where because it's decentralized no single entity is a
money transmitter you know like some people might argue that like oh the
miners are money transmitters and thus should be regulated kind of saw like
crazy statements like that and we even now we're hearing this about lightning
right where people are like oh lightning nodes are money transmitters but it it
gets to the fact that like one of the cynical views on Bitcoin is that it's a
form of regulatory arbitrage by being decentralized you can avoid these labels
that come with a lot of government imposed regulations and Bitcoin like
you know people you'll see politicians going hey we need to regulate Bitcoin
and then they realize oh wait it's not so simple but you'll learn eventually
you mentioned though that you know your software company and yet recently we saw
that you guys acquired a financial services company do you want to describe
that transaction and I don't know if there was kind of a public like vision
put out for why why that transaction occurred or if you're allowed to speak
to that but curious um I don't think that we've done any huge like press
releases regarding the long-term vision but I mean it's pretty obvious you know
we raised a series B of something like 43 million dollars and we then use some
amount of that I don't even know how much to purchase Kingdom Trust and
Kingdom Trust is actually one of our larger customers we've been working with
them for a number of years they run the Bitcoin IRA and they have something like
12 billion dollars worth of crypto assets that they are a custodian of on
behalf of people who want to hold various crypto assets inside of their
tax advantaged retirement account and the the main reason for this is that you
know we do see a shift in interest in the ecosystem where a lot of
institutional investors are becoming more interested in crypto assets but and
this is highly ironic I believe I don't know if the irony is lost on them but due
to various regulations around like financial compliance in the way that
these institutional investors and various funds operate is that there has
to be a qualified custodian of assets in order for the investors to hold the
assets or more specifically the custodian holds the assets for the
investors and so basically we were having to pass up a lot of deals from
these type of institutions and clients because we were not a custodian and even
if we were technically a custodian we were not you know falling under the like
financially compliant you know regulated custodian model and I know we looked into
a number of different things and like trying to set up trusts and all of that
and at the end of the day the most efficient way for us to be able to
acquire that status was to just acquire Kingdom Trust or some other entity that
was already you know reputable and licensed and basically performing
those services so we're just folding them under the arm of BitGo and we're
gonna continue to expand our offerings into the custodial front but we are by
no means becoming a like fully custodial company we'll continue to operate you
know hot wallets for people in a non-custodial fashion. That's really
interesting yeah and I think that it's it speaks to the increasing
realization that crypto but even Bitcoin specifically is a long-term investment
and it's kind of it's caused I think a bit of a philosophical rift within the
community because whenever people talk about Bitcoin as an investment there's
always at least one comment that's like guys this can't grow this Bitcoin can't
you know appeal to more people if people are not spending their bitcoins and you
know using their bitcoins so that they can buy goods and services. What's your
view on that like tension between hodling and using quote-unquote Bitcoin?
Yeah I mean well first of all hodling is using so that's one of the big
disconnects but it's been interesting especially you know as we've had so many
bubbles over the years and the exchange rate keeps going up by orders of
magnitude and and sometimes I try to look back on it and think like why do I
still have almost all of my coins like I didn't I didn't sell any crypto assets
before this past year in 2017 and the only ones I sold were all these altcoin
air drops so that I could just buy you know get more bitcoins from those of
course that resulted in me having a big tax bill which is not fun but I I can
see why you know some people are in situations where they need to have a
censorship resistant form of money or they need to be able to make payments
globally quickly without going through traditional systems but I think the vast
majority of people that I meet and talk to don't really fall into that camp like
almost everybody I know and talk to has credit cards and they can do wire
transfers and use Venmo and PayPal and blah blah blah and you know for the vast
majority of their day-to-day transactions it's fine for them to use
those systems like I I don't think I need to worry about you know Visa
canceling my payment to Amazon for buying some books or software or
whatever so like personally I see the majority of the utility and value in
these systems is in holding my wealth in a fashion that is not confiscatable by
anyone and this has actually become even more clear to me over the past few
months as I was going through the process of selling these forks and
converting them into bitcoins and converting a fair amount into dollars to
pay the tax bill because I ended up spending well over several days in
aggregate in December trying to get dollars from all these different
exchanges into my bank accounts so that I could pay the IRS and I had problems
at Coinbase and G Dax and Kraken and Gemini is like every exchange as soon as
I started to try to use the traditional financial system again was just screwing
with me and made my life a lot harder it would been and I hate to say this but my
life would have been much easier if I could have just sent a crypto asset to
the IRS and you know I think that the person who would hate to hear that is
Roger Ver who is essentially through through his activism providing more
funds to the IRS's people have to pay taxes on on his quote-unquote airdrop
so all right and so I I think that we've heard of other companies trying to get
into the like institutional custodian game like I think the Coinbase launched
a product where to sign up you have to pay a hundred grand which to me is just
that's the market right if that and that indicates how much demand there is for
this for this kind of product and so but at the same time like back in 2014 I
feel like I would always hear this is the year of Wall Street this is the year
that like you know big institutions are going to start buying or this is the
year that an ETF comes out and those narratives always seem to get pushed
back six months or a year and the flip side is that I've these are concrete
steps towards that and it seems to be getting more and more realistic yeah I
think that you know 2018 really will be the year of the institutional investor
getting in and the main reason that I say that is that anecdotally I have
started to get contacted by wealth management firms and and all kinds of
institutional investors who they they want basically to fast forward on the
Bitcoin crypto education you know and so they're willing to pay me a premium for
my knowledge dump to help them get a better understanding of this without
spending months and months trying to understand you know the entire history
of how we got here and it's funny to me that you know it's so political right
because if they ask you for a knowledge dump it's going to be a very different
knowledge dump than if they asked someone who works at R3 or you know
who's really like in the oh it's blockchain technology not Bitcoin or
distributed ledger technology and I was listening to a podcast put out by
Goldman Sachs this morning and the lady was saying that oh Bitcoin and the
current generation of crypto currencies they're inherently flawed because they're
too volatile and they are not mediums of exchange they're not stores of value
because they just went down by 60% and no one's using them as a unit of
account and so you know we're we think that the value is going to drift towards
zero over the long run and I like obviously you know I was raging but it
did provoke some of my own tweeting and so someone who has that let's call it an
economic ideology they're going to have like a very hard time having a
conversation with people who are in our camp yeah and well a lot of these calls
that I've been having are interesting because they're basically blind calls
where it's myself and a coordinator who understands the space somewhat well
enough to come up with some good questions and and we basically have a
conversation and I don't even know who the various investors are you know
there's like a hundred people just listening passively to this conversation
so you know I'm sure that they are getting a diverse set of opinions and
doing these type of listening conference calls with all kinds of different
perspectives but you know if we can get at least a few of them to understand our
perspective I think we'll capture their attention and I think that the most
interesting question that gets posed by investor types is what do you see as the
biggest weakness for Bitcoin like what is Bitcoin's Achilles heel and I would
be really interested in hearing your answer for that one well I mean the the
biggest weakness is apathy if if people lose interest that is how Bitcoin dies
and that's also why I think that it's incredibly difficult if not impossible
to kill a crypto asset that is decentralized by any fashion I mean you
only need to have a handful of people that are interested enough in one of
these protocols to run the nodes and secure them in some manner of consensus
and and you have a quote-unquote working crypto asset now then you know the sort
of range of what working really means can vary widely but as it as long as
there are a sufficient number of people who are devoting their resources to
continually maintaining and improving the systems I don't see how it can die
if a problem comes up then we fix it and move on and that's where a lot of the
anti-fragility of these systems comes into play where the system it could
crash you could have a market crash it could have a technical crash where the
network goes down but the anti-fragility is due to all the different actors who
make up the system who then come together and say okay we we make this
tweak and we bring it back online and that's something where I think I said
recently if you know the network might take a nap for a little while but
eventually it's gonna come back and the the heartbeat of you know blocks and
transactions coming in will resume right all right and I I think that when I got
this question my answer was that it really would be I was you you're
thinking of it at a meta level which I think is the right approach to to
reasoning about what would actually be a problem for Bitcoin and I was kind of
thinking of it a little too concretely in that my answer was there well if if a
government controls their internet then they could conceivably block Bitcoin and
have a firewall of sorts that prevents Bitcoin from you know being a viable
like granted someone could always use a satellite dish although even that I was
thinking like couldn't a government be flying drones over and making sure that
your satellite dish is not pointed at block stream satellite I mean I'm sure
they can jam you know signals at different frequencies you know there
probably is a decent point to be made that you know the Bitcoin protocol
itself like the message passing is not encrypted it is you know clear text I
mean technically it's like highly compressed you know binary but it could
be very easily you know sniffed and filtered and blocked and that's why I
guess you can make a strong argument for you know small blocks and compact
blockchain size because that makes it easier to use other forms of more
privacy available communication you know like a tour so if you wanted to you know
run a blockchain with hundred megabyte blocks or gigabyte blocks over tour
that's probably not going to be feasible but at least now with the current block
size and block weight you can still do that right and on that note like what
what do you see as what excites you about Bitcoin in 2018 I think it's it's
all gonna be about lightning and lapse and actually like connecting all of
these decentralized networks together so you know the the ecosystem has grown
significantly over the past few years there's far more crypto assets than
anyone can even possibly keep track of but we still have some systemic issues
mainly you know these centralized exchanges which we had a pretty good run
for a little while where there weren't any major exchange hacks but now we
seem to have another wave of exchange hacks coming in probably just as more
new entrants are coming into crypto starting exchanges and failing to learn
from their predecessors so I'm interested in you know decentralized
exchange protocols and atomic swapping for privacy reasons and also for like
health of the crypto ecosystem basically because if you're just using software
and a protocol to have economic exchanges and changing assets and
trading with other people peer-to-peer then you've removed these honey pots
that you know everybody puts their money into and attracts all the attention from
hackers and results in a lot of people losing money due to one really stupid
exploit that you know somebody accidentally put in and if you're just
doing it in a decentralized fashion sure you might get hacked but if you get
hacked it's not like everybody else also gets hacked so I think it makes things
more robust and it also is just kind of smooth the process of exchanging so even
from a not a security level but just a scalability level a lot of exchanges
have had problems with their multiple orders of magnitude of growth and the
exchanges have been falling over or just been so slow that they're unusable and
you can't even trade on them and that's just once again because they're
centralized and everybody is going into one little point so I think that you'll
also see you know fewer types of congestion there if you're able to
actually do your trades across a more decentralized network yeah my hang up
with decentralized exchanges has always been the fiat interface which seems to
rely on like me giving my bank info to someone so that they can go deposit cash
and in my account which and that aspect of it doesn't seem particularly
scalable to me but in terms of crypto to crypto there I can see that that's
definitely much more robust yeah and maybe we'll see a rise of a stable coin
that can be used on these networks you know tether has been a hot topic
recently there's there's no reason I guess why you couldn't have a lightning
network compatible tether now of course like any of these stable coins that are
you know ultimately backed by fiat are gonna have a trusted third party single
point of failure at some point but you could at least you know create this
gateway where people can use that single trusted point to get into a crypto
system where you have you know more liquidity and you're just able to move
around a lot faster without permission from everyone so when I saw you tweet
about decentralized exchanges I thought to myself well is that's interesting
because aren't bit goes most you know most of their customers are exchanges
like I don't want to get you into hot water or anything but it seems like
you're you're suggesting that big go would be obsoleted somehow because now
we don't need these big honey pots with a bunch of coins that need to be
secured yeah I mean I think the ecosystem is going to continue to change
in a number of different ways and people are gonna adapt and you know some of
these exchanges are going to innovate and they're going to find out ways to
to pull these technologies in and make their exchange even better and you know
probably offer hybrid models but you know bit go we have been pretty good
about staying on the forefront of innovation in this space we got you know
segwit active on our platform within a few weeks of it being activated on the
network and you know we are big fans of payment channel technology so we've got
a team of guys that are are working on various ways that we could use payment
channels both internal to bit go and eventually of course external with a
lightning network compatibility so the the general idea I guess of bit go is
that we're going to serve whatever market demand there is and so while you
know bitco did start out as a Bitcoin only thing you know as we got a lot of
exchanges coming on to our platform and then the exchanges were basically saying
hey we we want this same security model for coins X Y & Z we were like okay you
know we'll do the work and we'll add those and that's a lot of how we got to
where we are today and now it's more turned into like aetherium and you know
adding support for all these different tokens and you know hopefully in 2018
it'll be lightning network and adding support for various types of
applications on there so it's going to be a fast-moving space yeah and it's a
lightning network use case that I've heard of that rang as being
particularly useful to me is the inter exchange arbitrage where you would be
able to instantly send bitcoins from one exchange to another whereas currently
it's kind of a it can be a haphazard process especially when the mempool gets
backed up you don't really know how long you're going to be in limbo for yeah
there's been a number of products you know just targeting nothing more than
arbitrage you know we've that's really what blockstreams liquid sidechain is
about and I learned at Satoshi roundtable that is the main reason why
tether came about is that it was well tether was created you know on master
coin slash Omni and it was then actually a bit Phoenix that was like you know
what we have a lot of traders who would love to use some sort of dollar backed
coin in order to be able to arbitrage between exchanges because we're having a
lot of banking problems and you can see if you read any of these things about
tether that it was in fact serving a very big market and the market grew to
be so big that there's something like two billion dollars worth of tether now
that have been issued Wow that's it and so they're like everyone obviously is
concerned about I think that the going theory is that tethers get printed to
pump up the price of Bitcoin yeah kind of like I think back in 2013 well we
only found out about it after the fact but this thing called Willie bought on
Mount Gox that supposedly was pumping up the price and so there's always kind of
a manipulation narrative in every Bitcoin run-up that we see and so I guess
like what are your thoughts on that and I know that things were said at the
Satoshi roundtable that seemed to be reassuring in that regard yeah so the
the simple explanation for why so many tethers came about was like I said they
were being used for arbitrage and basically the process is that traders
on Bitfinex who want to arbitrage will sell their bitcoins for the USDT the
tether and then send that to another exchange and then buy crypto on that
exchange and actually you know benefit from the arbitrage when they do that
they're sending tether out of Bitfinex's tether wallet to the tether wallet on
another exchange so the balance and Bitfinex's tether wallet goes down and
as more and more traders do that eventually the balance reaches a
critical level where they're not going to be able to do any more withdrawals and
so at that point Bitfinex sends actual dollars to the bank account of Tether
Inc and Tether Inc then goes through a process to issue more tethers at which
point they send those to Bitfinex's tether wallet and the process repeats so
basically like as those tethers move out and spread through the exchange
ecosystem more of them end up getting issued so that Bitfinex can continue to
offer the ability to arbitrage with them what raises my eyebrow though is that
the exchange who which is receiving the UST is then it seems as though it's not
going to Tether Inc to get US dollars they seem to just be holding on to it
which seems unusual from like a risk management perspective yeah so it was
asked you know like what is your normal level of you know tethers that you want
to hold and you know why why is it just growing and growing and actually they
were saying you know after the recent correction that they were actually
expecting to decommission to you know deissue a fair number of tethers because
a lot of that demand has dropped off for now so hopefully we will see it
fluctuating some as the markets fluctuate as well yeah and then the
other aspect of it is just like the regulatory like KYC AML aspect of it
where you know this this would make sense to me if it was an actual bank
issuing this although even there like they they would need to know who the
tethers are being sent to right and if tethers they use the same kind of
blockchain the Bitcoin does right so it's it's pseudonymous and I I don't I
don't want to drag on this conversation for too long but that's that was on my
mind as well yeah that question came up as well and I think the response was
that well there's AML KYC coming in and going out and no one controls what's
going on in once you're in just inside the system itself but yeah I mean that
makes sense from a technical standpoint from a regulatory and financial
compliance standpoint I have no idea yeah I am NOT a lawyer it's interesting
well okay so what would you say other interesting conversations you had at
this Toshi roundtable really caught your attention I know there's been a couple
of write-ups now about it but I'd be curious to hear your thoughts um let's
see which ones can I actually talk about though um so we there was a lot of talk
about security especially physical security and you know I got to hear some
specific examples from some of the more prominent people in the space and stuff
that they do and you know some of them have you know armed guards and armored
vehicles and you know really go all out because they're in a position where a
they can afford to spend the money on that type of thing but B it makes sense
for them to do that this is especially the the people who live in countries
that have you know higher rates of crime so you know it's nice in America I think
we we don't have as many you know kidnappings and extortions and like
organized crime of that nature so I'm hopeful that I don't have to worry about
that at least anytime soon but you know as this whole ecosystem continues to
grow if there's there are more like orders of magnitude price appreciation
then that's just going to make people bigger and bigger targets and the the
more interesting thing that I think we talked about was the difference between
like the traditionally wealthy people and the crypto wealthy people because you
don't really hear about you know billionaires or folks on the Forbes top
500 you don't hear about them you know getting kidnaps and extortions and other
types of stuff like this and I think the main reason for that is that their
assets are not liquid and you can't really steal large percentages of their
wealth because they're just tied up in all types of different things that can't
really be stolen so I think that we should actually learn a lesson from that
and figure out you know how to make our own crypto wealth almost impossible to
be stolen you know even under duress you know if a gun is pointed at your head
you should not be able to transfer 100% of your assets or even a significant
portion of your assets right reducing the liquidity of your bitcoins suddenly
becomes an important aspect which generally people think of it in the
reverse yeah that is troublesome and I think that we are fortunate here in the
US and at the same time we can't be too lackadaisical in that regard
thankfully I'm still crypto poor so I don't have but the problem is that
someone doesn't even necessarily know that right like they just see oh Pierre
comments on Bitcoin a lot he must be like Brock Pierce I'm like no I'm nowhere
near Brock Pierce okay have you tried tweeting out that you're not a crypto
millionaire yeah I had too much student loan debt to pay off to be in that league
but they did in their minds it's not really it's not really relevant to the
crime right and these people might not even be necessarily the most
intelligent people around and then the other thing too though I I try to make
this point as often as possible because I saw it firsthand when I was working at
BitPay and now this is sensitive information but it's public too because
BitPay decided to sue their insurer and so all of this information became
public but social engineering is a lot less risky than actually physically
physically engineering with a wrench or a rubber hose I think is the the common
trope because at the end of the day if you can be sitting you know in your
basement in Eastern Europe sending out phishing emails and trying to get
people to click on things and at BitPay specifically you know they lost a
couple million dollars worth of bitcoins in 2014 which today obviously is orders
magnitude more and likewise so that's kind of like the the easy like social
engineering phishing attack but then there's I think there's more
sophisticated ones which I broadly call scams where basically someone is a sold
on an ICO or something else like that and they voluntarily part with their
money without ever having a gun put to their head instead they have a dollar
sign put in front of them you know it's it's kind of the carrot and stick in in
the nefarious way that's a it's the angler fish I think but yeah I mean a
couple thoughts on that that's why you know you can't just protect your your
crypto assets and your private keys you have to protect your phone you have to
protect your email you have to put two-factor hardware authentication on
every online account that is associated with your identity that supports it and
especially from the phone standpoint at least in America apparently there's
something stupid about America that makes it so that it's easy for someone to
just walk into a phone store and claim to be you with a few pieces of
information and and take over your phone numbers steal your identity and and now
you know be able to use like 2FA reset functionality to get into a lot of your
accounts so I actually recommend Google Fi for phone service because they
literally have no stores that anyone can walk into to reset that they require a
pin in order to do any phone porting so I had that exact thing happen to me with
Verizon where my phone got ported thankfully like as you said I had
everything on Google authenticator so there wasn't really any SMS things for
them to get to and what was really intriguing was the conversation I had a
couple of months later with the guy at Verizon who was like the forensic
investigator into it because you know you were saying you know someone walked
into a store and that was the initial story I got from Verizon when when I
called them about this and the investigator was like that is not what
happened and probably just called the phone number right well he's he didn't
say it directly but it seemed to imply that this was an inside job by a Verizon
employee who had a list and was just working the list and you know that's the
other concern is that even with Google Fi now I'm sure like this is much lower
risk at Google Fi than anywhere else and my my concern were not my concern my
issue with Google Fi is that I'm an ample Apple fanboy and they only have
Android so that disqualifies me from being more secure but yeah the inside
job issue is real and it's kind of like that's part of crypto anarchy that we
live in yeah and I guess going back to the scams and ICOs and tokens and
whatnot I think one of the more fascinating things of this seeing how it
all plays out is and obviously there's a lot of easy money in the system mainly
because the the hodlers who have been around who have more money than they
thought they ever would are now looking to you know get on the next thing and
then also just mainstream media coverage has brought in new entrants who want to
get in on the next thing that has resulted in these you know crazy
valuations and people throwing money at projects that there's like there's no
sane reason that you should entrust the people behind them with that much money
and I think that what we're gonna see happen is a starvation due to lack of
of technical skills where another thing that I talked about in my Satoshi
roundtable post was the general lack of developer supply in the crypto
ecosystem and so as a result like all this money has come into the crypto
ecosystem and there's a lag time for developers to get up to speed so as a
result we've got the you know salaries and consulting rates and everything for
experienced developers basically in a bubble right now and that will
eventually correct but not until enough supply of talented developers comes into
the space and I think that the various ICOs and projects that are nothing more
than a white paper but have tens of millions of dollars are gonna find that
tens of millions of dollars are not helpful when there's literally no one
with the skills available to give the money to to get them to build what you
want and I think that there's an additional like piece to this which is
that there's a difference between someone who's working with an existing
blockchain and who is you know whether it's maintaining a node or writing
implementing a node and really just trying to work with existing networks
and then someone who's being tasked with architecting and building an entirely
new network which was sold in a white paper and it doesn't exist yet and so
that that level of developer talent I would argue like so you've got your like
standard web developer and then you've got your blockchain developer who you
know they could contribute to Bitcoin core and then you've got someone 10x
that who could build Bitcoin core from scratch without reference to anything
else right like and so that person's basically on the level of Satoshi if if
what they're trying to accomplish is that innovative which or you know that
that seems far-fetched to me that any more than like six of those people
exist within the foreseeable future but maybe maybe I'm too skeptical about that
yeah I mean I think it takes many years of experience building these types of
protocols to get a knack for it and be able to do it in a conservative way
where you're not opening up any exploits and of course it's it's not a single
developer either like every developer is gonna make mistakes you have to have a
team of developers that are watching each other's backs and preventing them
from you know getting the mistakes any further than the initial code commit you
know preventing that from getting merged and deployed into the production
software because once it gets out there in the wild you can't take it back so
yeah those those level of protocol developers are really far in a few
between and have probably been in the crypto space for so long that they don't
need a salary and so you you're not gonna be able to convince them to work
for you probably for any level of money it's it's gonna be more ideological you
have to capture their interest right and so for these ICOs that are like
healthcare records on the blockchain I mean good luck finding a cypherpunk
who's ideologically motivated to create a system that it you know advertises
itself as being decentralized but at the end of the day it's probably unlikely to
be and is it would probably be an anti pattern if it were so it's really
like dentocoin like I don't know who's excited about improving the world of
dentistry but they got to find a developer and pay them to at least put
up some effort some level of effort and make it appear as though they're trying
to deliver on on these promises that they sold investors on but yeah I I
think that your your your argument about this being death by starvation is
probably accurate if they even get to that right like if they even intended to
ever hire anyone rather than just walking away and you know taking the
money with them which I think is it's got to be at least a third of the ICOs
the intent was just marketing and then we ghost yeah you know or pump and dump
scams or who knows what but you know I can't even keep up with them anymore so
I'm focusing on on Bitcoin and you know trying to build on it as a platform
rather than trying to make the crypto universe even more complicated so I are
you are do you have some lap ideas in mind that what kind of side projects do
you have in the pipeline side projects I mean the last project that I did was the
Bitcoin core config generator and that was mainly because I was keeping track
of how many different configuration options there are and it keeps going up
and up and I kept having to answer questions for people of like how do I
set up a node that can run on a Raspberry Pi or they can run on tour or
whatever I do have another project that I started and has language languished
for many months and that actually is a throwback it combines some of my earlier
skills with cloud computing and MapReduce job writing where I would like
to create a MapReduce framework where you can throw the raw block data files
into this MapReduce job and have it basically build the entire UTXO set and
build a fully indexed you know Bitcoin database because that's what I've been
working on for the past few years at BitGo is you know indexing services and
and those there are ways to make it multi-threaded but you still basically
have to start from the beginning and go the way to the end so that you're
tracking all of the UTXOs in and out but I believe that it would be possible to
create a multi-phase MapReduce job where with some of my initial testing that I
was doing a few months ago I think that you could get it to a point where you
could build an entire indexed perspective of the Bitcoin blockchain in
less than 20 minutes and you could just throw more mappers and reducers at the
job as the blockchain gets larger and larger and so you know we're at the
point now where the blockchain is around like 170 gigs and so it's still
manageable but if we're looking at this from a very long-term perspective then
we are going to want to have ways to destroy and rebuild you know fully
indexed perspectives of the blockchain in a much more rapid pace Wow so okay so
let's let's dig into that because you know currently Bitcoin Core you there's
a flag for a transaction index right to have that index be built and so
essentially for our audience out there what that entails is that you can then
query Bitcoin Core for a specific transaction ID and it will bring back
the data for that and are you what you're talking about is an address index
yes I'm talking about slicing and dicing it up in as many different ways as
possible you know UTXO age you know the date fields size attributes fees like
every aspect of a transaction that you can figure out programatically and
then have that indexed and easily queryable okay awesome and so this but
this is a right now you've got a proof of concept for that and then would you
be able to create a like I know Satoshi uses Grafana but what kind of interface
then would you be able to use for the UI yeah well I mean if you were doing an
interface it would probably be similar to any block explorer but I think that
this type of project would be more interesting to anyone who runs a large
scale wallet or other service or block explorer like really anyone who needs to
have the ability to query for Bitcoin data by things that are more interesting
than just the hash of a block or a transaction and that happens a lot if
you're running a wallet so for example at Bicco we have a lot of different
indexes on UTXOs and that's because we have fairly complex UTXO selection
algorithms and they're looking at a number of different things this reminds
me of the block side project which I think was built by the guys out of
Princeton and they they presented on this at scaling Bitcoin but basically
doing that with the Python library called pandas to allow scientists to dig
into the blockchain and query things differently so this sounds like a and I
think they're using a graph database for that if I'm correct so so yeah my my my
my I guess idea is even more on the like the first stage of that where then you
could plug and play like what type of database you want to actually put the
data into the hard part is just ingesting the the data quickly and then
constructing all the transactions and UTXOs and then once you get to that like
current state of the Bitcoin system then you can say okay I want to store this in
a graph database or my sequel or Mongo or H base or you know whatever floats
your boat for your particular application and I okay so now just when
you were describing at the beginning of the episode that you were able to get
your node to sync in what was that like 20 minutes not quite that fast 152
minutes of okay sorry yeah so two hours let's call it two and a half hours it
couldn't it also during those two and a half hours be making calls to a database
and dumping the data as it's working through it and doing things in real time
like that or would that slow it down way too much yeah well I mean there's
there's two different ways I guess to think about it of like would you want
the node itself to be throwing data out somewhere or do you want something else
to be ingesting the data and so all of the indexer services that we have at
BitGo and we have a couple different versions that we've written over the
years they're all you know listening to nodes and and querying them for data and
pulling data out of them though you can you know set up a node where every time
a block or a transaction comes in it you know makes a call out to some other
script so you know you can trigger or you can listen and ingest either way
like that's that's still a fairly linear progression though where Bitcoin core
will go out and and grab blocks asynchronously and sort of cue them up
but it still has to go through each block and each transaction in order in
order to actually make sure that all of the rules have been followed so I don't
think that Bitcoin core or any of the nodes like at the that particular level
would would ever really be fully parallelized it just becomes a very
different problem gotcha because so the reason you can do out of order is
because you're not doing validation at the same time you're you're assuming
valid okay very interesting and so you're operating a wide variety of nodes
at big go how many different altcoins are you guys supporting is that public
let's see so Bitcoin the only forks that we have are be cash and be gold we we do
have litecoin which was easy and then ripple and then aetherium and various
ERC 20 tokens and the bulk of my time recently has actually been spent
babysitting the aetherium nodes they have been just stalling and and falling
over and having a lot of operational issues and I think I wrote about that
recently some of the infrastructure issues there I've also had a number of
issues with ripple nose like just from a performance standpoint but both ripple
and aetherium on an operational standpoint tend to have issues with disk
IO and you know you could say well that's because they're getting popular
right so there there is a good argument to be made for having these like global
limits on the networks because at the end of the day it turns into like real
resource consumption for someone who is running the nodes and it just seems from
my experience that amongst all of these really popular networks that are having
scaling issues the only one that isn't you know having suffered from like
performance degradation at the node level is Bitcoin so well let's let's get
political then I mean wouldn't it be the case that everyone can just run an SPV
wallet and we only need very few services that will have well a twenty
five hundred dollar piece of hardware with a solid-state drive that's cutting
edge and we'll just connect our SPV well I mean that'll that'll get you you know
maybe 10x growth but I do have an article I wrote last year where I did a
lot of the math and let's see that article was called like can SPV scale
Bitcoin to a billion users and what I was basically showing there is that one
the the math that most of people gloss over when they're saying that SPV can
scale is they're only doing the math from the perspective of the SPV client
itself and yes those are highly efficient you know they've used on the
order of you know kilobytes of bandwidth and and you know hundreds of CPU cycles
which is basically nothing you know in order to verify a transaction but if you
switch around and you look at it from the nodes perspective that has to serve
those SPV requests it's actually having to go through and read all of the data
in the blocks in the blockchain that the SPV clients are requesting and saying
hey do I have any transactions here do I have any transactions here do I have any
transactions here and so it's a very you know asymmetric performance where it
scales very well on the SPV client end it scales very terribly on the node slash
server end gotcha and so the the point there then is that either you need to
have web wallets where you've got a trusted third party right or that there
would be another way to scale where you just sidestep that issue and you just
have coinbase run one node and you rely on that but that doesn't what would be
your problem with that solution yeah I mean it's pretty easy to you know scale
up web applications we've we've had you know decades of experience doing that
and there's a lot of technologies that are built for that but you're kind of
you know you're regressing the model once again where like we were talking
about earlier the centralized exchanges are creating systemic risk both from a
security standpoint and just from a usability standpoint of you know
everybody going trying to get through you know one little bottleneck that
you've created so we want to see these systems be as dispersed as possible we
also want people to be able to get the best security model that Bitcoin can
offer if they want it sure I mean the vast majority of people are not going to
run full nodes and may not even ever know what a full node is if we especially
if we go mainstream I mean they may not even be understanding that they're using
Bitcoin in certain cases it'll it'll be shoved so far down under the hood but we
want the the technology to be accessible to as many people as possible and give
them the option to run a node and to have the best security model if that's
really what interests them right and the security model in terms of verifying
transactions coming in that that they are valid per the consensus rules that
you are a subscriber to right essentially and so in that regard if
Coinbase was the one running their own node they get to decide what
Bitcoin is for you on your behalf with that you really ever having a say in it
whereas if you're running your own full node you are a member of the consensus
that you want to be a member of which hopefully is called Bitcoin but I have
nothing against people who want to call it be cash or bit gold or whatever so I
wanted to jump back actually as my last question you mentioned that you're
running these different nodes and you have to run a node for each erc20 token
no actually we don't and we we managed to set up our indexer for aetherium in
such a way where it's it's pretty efficient on the indexer side of things
where we were ingesting every transaction that comes into an aetherium
block but we're just looking for fingerprints basically we're looking for
fingerprints of bit goes multi-sig smart contract we're looking for fingerprints
of erc20 tokens and then if we see something that looks like it might be
interesting it might belong to a bit go wallet then we're actually making
various API calls to our own service to say hey is this actually a bit go wallet
but from the token standpoint we have the erc20 functionality built into the
bit go multi-sig smart contract so it's it's all like technically in the same
wallet you know same private keys it's just using different functionality
within the aetherium protocol so as a result we use the same indexer and we
just you know set a new balance that says you know this token balances X got
it and is it the case that like it's having all of these erc20 tokens inside
of aetherium is that contributing to the performance issues for the aetherium
node definitely just from the standpoint that the aetherium network is a lot
busier now and you know I don't I don't know the protocol quite at the level to
say like what the performance of you know running and validating an erc20
smart contract is versus other stuff though my understanding is that like our
multi-sig smart contract in general is pretty heavyweight and we are looking at
a few ways to to try to make it you know less pricey from gas terms you know in
order to execute various functionality within it but the the nodes themselves
they've just been having a lot of performance issues and part of that you
know is because we are running like full archive nodes we're not doing the like
warp sync or anything else like that you know we want to make sure that we're
doing full validation and and also it's just that the aetherium nodes they're
updating so much state you know blocks are coming in every 17 seconds or so in
in these full blocks have you know a hundred plus transactions and they're
they're just doing so much reads and writes from the the disk that you know
spinning disk doesn't really cut it anymore you need to have preferably
solid-state disk so that you have enough IOPS on it and it becomes kind of
ironically a problem because IOPS are cheap at a consumer level where you can
just buy a solid-state disk and get a lot of IOPS but at the the virtual
private server level which is what a lot of enterprises are going to be using
their you know cloud computing disk IOPS are insanely expensive and I'm not
entirely sure why that is but you know as a result we end up spending like
thousands of dollars a month to run an aetherium node that is performant on like
Amazon Web Services for example yeah maybe they price it like a restaurant
prices alcohol you know it's like they're where they make their money but
they make everything else look a little less expensive so yeah you're gonna have
to be running your own bare metal if you want to do that be an aetherium full
node in a cost-effective manner all right this has been a lot of fun Lopp thanks
for coming on where can people reach you where can people find you on the
internet well I'm most prolific on Twitter and my handle is Lopp L-O-P-P and
once you get there you can easily get to my other various properties but I have a
website at Lopp.net where I have all of the content I've ever created videos
interviews presentations and also educational resources of basically
everything that I think is interesting and worth reading within the ecosystem
yeah so if you go to Lopp.net slash Bitcoin I think it is and you are you
might be a developer or honestly you might even just you might not even be a
developer yet but you want to learn how to program go on Codecademy learn some
programming languages go to Lopp.net slash Bitcoin start reading as much as
you can because there is a real developer shortage out there so I would
highly encourage people to start getting involved and you got to start somewhere
granted you know the the best time to start is yesterday second best time is
today by by no means is it too late I think that people might have like this
misconception that it's quote-unquote too late like crypto is gonna continue
growing the the fundamentals haven't changed even if the price is down 60%
over the past month or whatever it may be it's still a very strong wave that's
occurring so anyway thanks Jameson it was a lot of fun and I hope to have you
back on at some point great thanks for having me chairman Giancarlo thank you
chairman Crapo ranking member Brown and distinguished members of the committee
I've submitted a written statement for the record that details the CFTC's work
and authority over virtual currencies but with your permission I'd like to get
begin briefly with a slightly different perspective and that is as a dad I'm the
father of three college-aged children a senior a junior and a freshman during
their high school years we tried to interest them in financial markets my
wife and I set up small brokerage accounts with a few hundred dollars that
they could use to buy stocks yet other than my youngest son who owned shares
in a video game company we haven't been able to pique their interest in the
stock market I guess they're not much different than most kids their age well
something changed in the last year suddenly they were all talking about
Bitcoin they were asking me what I thought and should they buy it one of
their older cousins who owns Bitcoin was telling them about it and they got all
excited and I imagine that maybe members of this committee may have some had some
similar experiences in your own families of late it strikes me that we owe it to
this new generation to respect their enthusiasm about virtual currencies
with a thoughtful and balanced response not a dismissive one thank you chairman
Giancarlo and I'll begin the questioning first I will say I've had
those dinner conversations with my own children and you're right this is an
incredibly interesting but growing new area of financial challenge particularly
among our least my children and yours

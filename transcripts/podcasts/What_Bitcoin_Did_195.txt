Hi there from Lubbock in Texas, how are you all? Welcome to the What Bitcoin Did podcast
which is brought to you by The Mighty Kraken, the best place to buy, sell and trade Bitcoin.
I'm your host Peter McCormack and today I get back to my beginner's guide to Bitcoin
where I have an interview with Jamison Lopp looking at Bitcoin privacy and OPSEC. But
before that, I have a message from my show sponsors. So first up, a massive shout out
to Travel by Bit who have sponsored my recent travel through South America. They are a travel
website which allows you to book flights and hotels using crypto. They also offer sats
back on purchases with up to 10% return to you in Bitcoin. Also, I always use different
sites to compare flights when I'm traveling. Expedio and Momondo are up there for me, but
I'm adding Travel by Bit into the mix because their pricing is very competitive and on a
number of routes, they were the cheapest. If you want to find out more, head over to Travel
by Bit.com which is T-R-A-V-E-L-B-Y-B-I-T.com. Next up, let's talk about Cointracker and
a big thanks to John, Chandan and EJ for supporting the show over the next three months. I'm going
to be catching up with the team in San Francisco. I'm going to find out a bit more about what
they do and how they approach the complexities around calculating your crypto taxes. And
with tax season upon us, it is time to get your shit together. And this year I've used
Cointracker to calculate my taxes and it couldn't have been easier to link my wallets and exchanges
and they calculated my tax in about a minute. Findings work in the US, UK, Canada and Australia
so you can join the other 100,000 users who use Cointracker and file your crypto taxes
in seconds. It is integrated with TurboTax, Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, as well as over
300 other exchanges and wallets, more than anyone else. And it's free for users who have
200 or fewer transactions in a tax year. And for the listeners of the show, you can also
get 10% off. Just use the link Cointracker.io forward slash a forward slash WBD. It is available
for the web, but they do have apps available in the Apple and Android app stores. But if
you want to find out more, head over to Cointracker.io which is C-O-I-N-T-R-A-C-K-E-R.IO. Also, especially
relevant to this show is CypherSafe. We're talking today about Bitcoin, OpSec and security
and one of the elements of that is protecting your private keys, protecting your seed. So
if you want a very cool way to back up your private keys, then their newly released Cypher
wheel is something you want to take a look at. It is a unique way to store your private
keys and it's machined from stainless steel and not just any stainless steel, but 303
stainless because that came out of one of their tests by James and Lopp. James has
these known tests where he tests all these different devices with acid and tries to crush
them and burn them and they change to 303 stainless because of one of those tests. It's
one of the coolest Bitcoin seed backup devices I've seen and it's designed to be physically
locked with a padlock and comes with a tamper evidence seal. So you can be aware of anyone
who made an attempt to steal your seed words. So come on, you bought a hardware wallet,
right? I know you're taking your Bitcoin security seriously. Now go that extra step,
secure it from physical disaster with a Cypher wheel seed storage device. To find out more
head over to CypherSafe.io which is C-Y-P-H-E-R-S-A-F-E.io.
Okay so onto the show and we're back to my Bitcoin beginners guide. Just got a few shows
left on this now. Had a brief pause while I did some of my shows in South America and
if you haven't already checked out the previous 11 episodes, make sure you go back and give
them a listen. We have covered everything from Bitcoin's history to the economics and
the technicals. But today I've got my Bitcoin buddy Jameson Loppack on the show, a renowned
Bitcoin privacy expert and someone I just had to get onto the Bitcoin beginners guide.
I think he's been on the podcast like five times now and you should go back and check
out those other shows. Even show number three which I recorded with Jameson over two years
ago now. So Jameson has put out his own set of Bitcoin guides and resources on his website
lopp.net. Make sure you go and check that out. They're incredibly helpful and he covers
everything you could possibly need. I'll leave a link for that in the show notes. But in
this episode Jameson and I get how you can remain as private as possible in your private
day to day life, your Bitcoin privacy best practices and how to improve your OBSSEC.
Just a couple of notes. I've just finished travelling around South America. We're now
putting together the footage from Venezuela, Colombia and Chile into a few little mini
documentaries. This is going to be my first attempts at making video. So you're going
to have to bear with me. But hopefully they'll be out soon. And then today I'm heading off
to San Francisco for a couple of days and then I'm going to be out to Vegas for Tome
Vase, Unconfiscatable and then back to the UK. Another crazy busy trip. So much has happened.
But if you've got any questions, feel free to hit me up. My email address is hello at
whatbitcoindid.com.
Good evening, Jameson. How are you?
Doing well.
It's been a little bit of time since you've been on the podcast. You were leading the
way previously, but we haven't done one in a while. So it's good to get you back. Are
you good? Are you ready for this?
Yeah, I've got to keep my count up as, you know, most recurring appearances.
Yeah, I think two of the beast has been, it's been chasing you down, but I think this will
put you back down in front. So, so listen, I've been doing this Bitcoin Beginner's Guide
super simple series, keeping everything as basic as possible. I've covered why you need
to care about Bitcoin. I've covered some of the tech, how it works, how you buy it, etc.
But now I want to get into the area of privacy and OpsSec. And I think we're safe in saying
that's, that's the Jameson lot bag, right?
I believe so. I've broken new ground in that area.
Alright, so I've put it down as there are five levels of OpsSec and privacy to care
about. The first one is that you just don't care. The second one is that you have basic
care for your online privacy and OpsSec. The next one is you have your basic Bitcoin privacy
and OpsSec. I've got advanced privacy and OpsSec and then I've got Jameson lot levels
of privacy and OpsSec. Because I don't know anyone who cares about it quite as much as
you. I don't think we're going to get into Jameson lot levels. This is for beginners
today. So we're going to try and keep it super basic, the things that people really need
to care about. And then what I'll do in the show notes, I'll include links to your various
articles and things you've done and also the previous show we made. So they've got access
to further information should they need it. Does that work for you?
Sounds good.
Right. So I think a very good starting point is that we're going to have various different
people listen to this show. There's going to be some people who are new to Bitcoin,
but we've also got people who've been using this as a refresher course. But for those
who are new, for those who have just gone down the rubber hole, they're working their
way through this series. Firstly, can you separate out what is privacy and what is OpsSec?
Sure. I mean, I think most people are familiar with the idea of keeping things private, keeping
secrets. Really the best way that I think it was described in a cypherpunk manifesto
is that privacy is the ability to selectively reveal yourself to the world, which means
that we don't necessarily need to keep everything a secret from everyone else, but we should
have the ability to decide when information gets disclosed. And of course in today's age,
the communication age, information is flowing so freely that this has become a very big
challenge and the default is that state that you talked about as not caring, because it
is very hard for people to care. It takes a conscious effort and in most cases people
don't realize what they've lost until it's too late. And of course I have my own story
around that and that has resulted in me going down a path that few have tread so far.
Well, so we'll cover that. I think it's good to do a little revisit to that story because
it is a very interesting story. And you know what, prior to getting into Bitcoin, I didn't
care too much. I didn't really give a damn, but I have changed. I still don't have great
privacy, but I have pretty good privacy and OpsSec with regards to my Bitcoin, but I still
make mistakes. I still do careless things. And also sometimes for convenience, I have
a trade off, but I think most people are aware of pivot privacy because you know, they have
options when they sign up to Facebook, they have a section on privacy and safety. They
have that a lot of social media. So I think they're aware of the idea of privacy. OpsSec
is...
It's a very general thing, right? I mean, everyone has windows and they have curtains
and you know, you have the choice at any point in time to keep the curtains open or closed.
But OpsSec is a step up. OpsSec is a bit more... You go into a bit more detail about protecting
yourself, right?
Yes. So, you know, this is originally a military term. I believe it really started in World
War II era, this idea of operations security. And the idea around that is that there were
military secrets that if they fell into the wrong hands could be disastrous for one side
of the war effort. And so this is kind of like taking the idea of privacy and then applying
it from the perspective of knowing that different information has different potential consequences
if it gets into the wrong hands. So I think a good example of this would be that if you
are publicly posting things that are trivial, you know, it's like, oh, I had this for dinner
tonight, then, you know, that was originally private information and you then decided to
disclose it with the world. But it's pretty unlikely that that information would somehow
be used against you, at least at this point in time. It's all about who your adversaries
are and what you think people are trying to do to you. So from the operations security
perspective, you kind of have to come up with a threat model of, you know, who might try
to use private information against me. And as a result, you know, what is the information
that is most important for me to keep secure? And so we'll probably go into that later,
but it really comes down to what are the most common types of attacks and what is the information
that, you know, the most number of adversaries out there are trying to get from you and use
against you. Okay, great. Well, listen, we'll keep it ultra basic to begin with. Let's just
forget about Bitcoin for now. It doesn't matter who you are, you should really care about
your privacy. It is something that is important. But but why is it and why now more than ever
should people take an interest in this? Well, the the main reason that I tried to get across
in some of my posts is that you don't know what's going to happen in the future. You
don't know where like some data that you currently consider to be unimportant might suddenly
become much more important. And so, you know, for example, in my case, I went from being
basically a nobody to over the course of just a couple of years, having a ton of attention
directed at me. And as a result, a much higher number of adversaries and people trying to
attack me, generally digitally. And when it got to the point that someone wanted to, you
know, find my actual physical address and use that against me, this was, you know, the
form of attack that I had never really thought about before that I didn't think was a problem.
I mean, not many people consider that to be a highly sensitive piece of information because
you give your address out probably several times a day to almost any entity that you
deal with. And so my case is probably rare, the sort of becoming famous type of case.
But there are plenty of examples of that happening really due to social media. And in one example
that I give out fairly often is Justine Sacco, who posted a bad tweet basically as she was
getting on a plane. It was a very bad joke and it went viral and basically tens of millions
of people got really pissed off at her. And, you know, by the time she landed, she had
all types of, you know, digital attacks basically happening against her. It affected her employment,
her family, and just really had a cascading effect across her entire life, all as the
result of one tweet. And, you know, she only had about 200 Twitter followers. But this
is the sort of asymmetry that we have to deal with today, these unpredictable, unintended
consequences.
It's funny, I have a little Jameson Lopp who sits on my shoulder now. And when I'm
traveling or going to different places, he sits there and just reminds me of certain
things. And it's the basics, Jameson. Like whenever I sign up to free Wi-Fi at a hotel
or at an airport, I never use my correct email address. I mean, we're talking about the basics
here, but they always work if you put in a fake email address. Every single time I do,
and then every time when I've left the airport or hotel, I disconnect the history of that
connection to using that Wi-Fi from my computer. And that's just a single example. I could
give a few, but the point being is that by having my own awareness, I carry that around
with me wherever I go and just start to consider things. One of the things that might be difficult
for people, like they might have listened to a bunch of these shows, and it might be
a lot to take in all the stuff we go through now. But I think the real lesson is you have
to develop a practice that suits you. And just having the awareness, you know, whether
you're signing up for Wi-Fi, when you're in a store buying something, all the things
you're doing, you can leave a trail of information everywhere. And you just need to be aware
of that and whether you do want to leave that information.
And ultimately, I think most people can deal with and understand some of the more common
issues because they are making the news. And that is basically the data leaks. It's, you
know, almost every week, it seems like we hear about a new hack where hundreds of millions
or billions of accounts and all of their personal information on those accounts got leaked through
any number of exploits or just careless configurations on the part of, you know, e-commerce people
or data warehousing providers, et cetera, et cetera. And this is, once again, just the
result of the information age and how quickly and easily information flows. It's very hard
to keep information secure. Once you give information to a third party, you are, you're
trusting them. You're assuming that they are putting all of the best practices into place.
But really, at the end of the day, it's a numbers game. If you're giving your information
out to hundreds or thousands of third parties, you're basically guaranteeing that at some
point your personal information is going to get leaked and then distributed around.
And undoing that is going to be a very, very difficult thing to do. Okay, so if we move
on to the next step, because, you know, the people listen to this, they have an interest
in Bitcoin that, you know, they might have been in Bitcoin for a couple of years and
using this as a refresher, or they might be brand new to Bitcoin, they might have just
bought their first amount or think about buying their first amount. When we get into the
world of Bitcoin, privacy and OPSEC isn't really a choice. You really have to start
taking this very seriously.
Yeah, so once again, you have to really decide what is your threat model. The extreme that
some people go to in the Bitcoin space is making sure that their identity never gets
connected to any of the coins that they have acquired. Unfortunately, this is actually
an incredibly challenging thing to deal with due to the transparency of Bitcoin and the
auditability of the blockchain. And you can avoid buying Bitcoin without having your identity
tied to it, though that generally requires doing things like over the counter trades
or face to face trades. But even if you get to that point, then you have to ask yourself
every time you make a transaction, are you essentially giving away which coins belong
to you because, you know, the person you're sending money to could potentially look up
and see, you know, where the money is coming from. So if you want to be 100% private in
that fashion, then you basically have to make every spend that you're sending to someone
go through a mixer or some other obfuscation method. But, you know, for most people, I
think that the easy thing, the most important thing to do is just not post your addresses
in public places. This is actually something that I've run into a lot as I've been doing
various research of historical events in Bitcoin is that I've gone back, you know, eight, nine,
10 years ago. And back then, people were just publishing their Bitcoin addresses in forum
posts and leaving trails all over the place. And so that was terrible for them, though
very helpful for me when I wanted to basically de-anonymize some of the early adopters and
what they were doing many years ago.
So I'm going to make an assumption that most of the people listening to this, their first
purchases are going to probably be on a Kraken, a Coinbase, a Cash App. It's going to be somewhere,
you know, one of these very public exchanges. And I think it's going to be very difficult
for these people for day one to operate perfect privacy practices. But at the same time, when
they start, one of the things they need to be aware of, and the thing you've talked to
me about before in the past is that even if it's a small amount of money, that can become
a life change amount of money later on. So are there any things that people can do early
on? Can they create multiple addresses and distribute their Bitcoin amongst multiple
addresses so it doesn't look like they have too much? Are there any early basic practices
they can do?
There are. And, you know, it once again, it comes down to who you're trying to protect
yourself against. I think if we don't worry about, you know, nation state level attackers,
then really the most important thing is not to, you know, broadcast your addresses all
over the place publicly. Also not to reuse addresses. You know, at the very least, when
you are receiving coins, it costs you nothing to generate a new address. And that means
that whoever is sending you the coins can't look up on the blockchain and say, oh, you've
received all of these other coins at the same address. As I mentioned earlier, the flip
side, unfortunately, is then when you are sending money to other people, they could
potentially look back in your history. But it, you know, you may not necessarily care
about that. It just depends on, you know, the sensitivity of what you're doing and whether
or not you're worried about your counterparty learning more information about you. But at
least by having those funds, you know, split up amongst more addresses, it would be difficult
for someone you're sending money to, to see, you know, your entire wallet. But there are
many different types of adversaries on the network that are doing many different types
of listening for data, whether it's on the blockchain or the network or, you know, harvesting
data from various providers, like exchanges. And, and so, you know, it's hard to stay completely
out of the off the radar of everything. But I think by keeping a low profile, you know,
not associating your real identity with any coins, like at least on on social media, you
know, in the public, that is going to get you a lot further than what I think a lot
of people do by default.
Yeah, so that's something that's difficult for you and I, because, you know, we both
work in the industry, you work for one of the best companies in the Bitcoin space, I
have a podcast, so we're known, we're known people. But some people coming in might see
that there's a lot of very well known names in the industry. But their names are funny
accounts with funny pictures, you don't actually know who these people are. And one of the
reasons is they're trying to protect themselves from such situations. And I think it's also
worth mentioning that we're not just talking about people trying to hack you here. I mean,
you run a GitHub page which logs a history of physical attacks on people, right?
Yes. And thankfully, I would say the relative number of physical attacks has remained pretty
low. But what I was more interested in was just seeing if there's a correlation between
general awareness of Bitcoin and the physical attacks. And there really does seem to be
a strong correlation there. And it makes sense because as Bitcoin goes more mainstream than
more people, including people who are willing to commit violent crimes or essentially threaten
others in order to get their money, are starting to look at Bitcoin and weigh the risk and
reward and try to figure out if there's easy money to be made in this ecosystem.
Well, I've broken down the privacy things that people should care about into three categories.
I've got your general privacy, which is your general personal privacy. I've got the specific
items relating to Bitcoin and then I've separated your internet privacy. So let's start with
the absolute basics of privacy. One of the things I did do after reading your article
on Medium was I switched off a number of location services on my phone and I also deleted a
number of the Google apps and stopped using most of the Google apps. Why is it that you
recommend people switch off those location-based services? And also, what is your view related
to Google services?
Yeah, I mean, the main problem I have with a lot of apps asking for far more information
from your phone than they probably need is that you don't know what's going to happen
with that information. And we've actually seen several cases where that information
is getting collected and then resold to third parties. And so it once again comes down to
would an attacker be able to use this information against you if they can figure out your patterns?
And I think a really easy thing to look at as well. Most people, they leave their house
during certain periods of time to go to work or go to the gym or they have basically a
pattern. And so even from that perspective, if someone could view your location over a
long period of time, they figure out what your life patterns are and can use that against
you to perhaps break into your house when they know that you're not going to be there
or otherwise set up some sort of trap because they know where you're going to be at a certain
time. And that, of course, is getting more on the physical security side of things. But
there are also just a lot of unintended consequences from all of this information coming out, usually
things that you wouldn't really think about, basically being able to determine private
parts of people's lives. Say, for example, you're going to a certain store or establishment
that might be considered embarrassing, that would show up in your history as well. It's
hard to even come up with all of the things that could go wrong. But suffice to say, most
people would not appreciate being followed around by a private investigator that's tailing
them all day long. That would creep most people out. But essentially that's what we're doing
is we're carrying around the device in our pocket and then allowing the data to flow
out and basically be investigated by any number of entities.
Some of us have got very used to services that rely on location, Uber, Google Maps,
various things like that. Is there an alternative? Is there a way of being able to carry on using
these apps without giving away too much information?
It really comes down to an app by app basis. And I've had to do a lot of trial and error
with them. In many cases, a lot of these apps actually have browser based versions and the
browser based version usually also works on the mobile phone. So it's hard to make a blanket
statement about them. But even with things like Uber and Lyft, I've found at least using
Uber without any location services, it looks really janky, but it still works. You just
don't get quite the same level of real time updates and everything. But I think the engineers
at these companies want their apps to work in as many situations as possible.
What about in terms of your home and your mail? Are the things related to how you consider
your house and where you live or where you work and things like that, that you should
be especially considerate about?
Yes, though almost nobody is going to go to the level of I think trying to protect their
mailing address. It is actually pretty easy to do. You can set up re-mailing services
for probably around $50 a month. But the basic idea there being that you are giving away
your mailing address every time you buy something online. In many cases, every time you even
buy something digital online, like if you're not getting something shipped to your house,
people are often giving their address away as a part of the credit card and billing process.
If you don't want to go to the trouble of actually setting up a PO box or a re-mailer,
you can at least protect your address on the billing side of things by using a service
like Privacy.com, for example, which basically allows you to create these throwaway digital
credit cards. The nice thing about it, other than just the security side of being able
to lock down each one of these cards so that each card has a limit and gets locked to a
specific merchant, is that the card will validate with absolutely any mailing address that you
give to it. You can put in a completely junk mailing address and the charge will still
be processed on it.
What about social media? This is probably the place where I think most people are careless,
the way they use Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. I don't think we're going to change
a lot of people. I don't think we're going to stop people using these services. I know
a few have dumped Facebook, but my expectation is most people are going to continue using
them. Is there a way of using them in a more privacy focused way?
For a while before I completely dumped Facebook, I was using, I think it was called Tinfoil
Hat, but there was basically a stripped down version of Facebook app. I think it was basically
running the Facebook mobile site through the app and stripping out a lot of the tracking
bugs and whatnot. On Instagram, I'm not as sure. I've also ended up dumping that, but
really it's not just about using that single app, but actually about your entire web browsing
experience. The problem, at least with Facebook and Google and some of the other large tracking
sites out there, is that the genius thing that they've done is that they've managed
to get their buttons and their tracking code distributed across who knows how many, possibly
millions of websites out there. As you're going around the internet, just minding your
own business, these tracking bugs are getting fired. Facebook and Google and the other trackers
can basically aggregate all that information and see a very large portion of your web browsing,
your history. That's why it's actually, I would say, more important that you just set
up some decent ad blockers on any browser that you're using so that you're making it
harder for these services to piece together all of your browsing history.
Can you recommend some specific ad blockers that you think are the best, that are usable?
I use Brave, and I think Brave is a great browser, but are there any other specific
services you would recommend?
Brave has some decent ad blocking. In terms of browser extensions, I like uBlock Origin.
Also, I'm a fan of Privacy Badger, which is a tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
And really, I would install all of the browser extensions from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
They also have one called, I think, HTTPS Everywhere, which tries to force all of your
browsing connections to be encrypted for your own good.
Yeah, I've got that one. I've got that based on our previous session.
Next up, I talked to James some more about Bitcoin Privacy and OpSec, but before that,
I've got a message from my amazing sponsors. So first up, we have BlockFi, the future of
Bitcoin and financial services, my longest serving sponsor, and they're going to be renewing
again. I caught up with Zach. We talked about everything that's happened since we started
working together. And he's like, Pete, we're sticking with you. So that's very, very cool.
Big up to you, Zach. Big up to Florrie. And congratulations on the new round. They've
just raised another $30 million. They are absolutely smashing it as a company. And so
many cool things are coming this year. Most of all, I cannot wait for the Sats Back credit
card that's coming. Yes, you will be able to win Bitcoin back just by spending money
on their credit card. Get me that soon as possible, Zach. I want to play with that.
I want to tell people about it. Also, they've got a mobile app coming, which is very cool.
Much needed. This is on top of their already market leaning products. They have their crypto
back loans where you can take a loan out against your crypto. And they also have their interest
accounts over which I'm a customer, where you can earn interest on your Bitcoin, Ether
or GUSD. It's going to be a massive year for BlockFi. Love working with them. Can't wait
to see what they do this year. If you're interested in finding out more, please do your own research,
then head over to BlockFi.com, which is B-L-O-C-K-F-I.com. And lastly this week, but never least, because
you know I love them. It's The Mighty Kraken, the best place to buy, sell and trade Bitcoin.
But why? Why do I always say this? Why is Kraken the company I trust more than anyone
else? Well, they are consistently rated the best and most secure cryptocurrency exchange.
Whatever your level of experience, Kraken has designed and built a streamlined Bitcoin
exchange for newcomers and experts alike. Their platform provides world class financial
stability by maintaining full reserves, healthy banking relationships and the highest standards
of legal compliance. They pair their global 24x7, 365 live chat with an extensive support
center to help ensure that your questions are answered and your needs are met around
the clock, no matter who you are or where you are. They offer an exclusive additional
layer of near real-time hyper-personality support through Kraken account management
program. And with Kraken Pro, their beautiful mobile first app, you can trade Bitcoin wherever
you want. There is no better place to trade Bitcoin. So what the fuck are you doing with
the app? Get on kraken.com or download the app. It's available for the iPhone or Android.
Just search for Kraken Pro, which is K-R-A-K-E-M-P-R-O.
OK, so let's get into the Bitcoin stuff now, because this is the stuff that's really important.
This is the stuff whether or not they listen to what you said about, you know, protecting
their phone against surveillance and things like that. You know, that's really down to
their privacy. But we do want people getting into Bitcoin to really make sure that they
protect their Bitcoin, that they don't get hacked. So what are the scenarios and what
are the attack factors that people are protecting against when they're considering their Bitcoin
privacy? Most of the time, I think people are just
worried about hackers, you know, someone getting access to their machine, whether it's a desktop,
laptop, mobile phone, whatever is running their Bitcoin wallet, and just stealing the
private keys and, you know, taking all the money because it can be gone in a matter of
milliseconds and then you can't get it back. And so the really safest and simplest thing,
I think, for most people to do is to buy a dedicated hardware device, whether that's
a Trezor or a Ledger or a cold card, that gets you to the next level of security where
your private keys are no longer on an internet connected device. It protects you from the
vast majority of hacking attempts. There are still ways then that hackers will try to fool
you to get you to send your money to them instead of to whoever you're trying to send
it to. But the next level of issues that I've kind of run into after getting to a hardware
device level of security is usually just phishing, social engineering, or in some cases, malware
inside of the browser itself. So I'm not a fan of using browser based wallets, even if
they're tied to a hardware device because there's so many things that can go wrong with
the browser, whether it's from malware or just like a bad browser extension. It's really
hard to keep the entire software stack completely free of any bad software. You know, there's
so many layers of software now, like no one can really know all of the code that they're
running at any given time. Right, I have both a Ledger and Trezor. Actually, I also have
a cold card, but I find the Ledger has the desktop app which I can use, whereas Trezor
tends to go via the browser. That's the thing you're talking about there. Exactly. It's
not difficult for a bad browser extension to start screwing with whatever is going on
in the browser and cause the user to basically be tricked into sending a transaction to an
address that gets swapped out at the last second. If you're not being extremely diligent,
there are a lot of things that can go wrong. But the nice thing about these hardware devices
is that if you are diligent, you can verify the amounts and the addresses of where your
transactions are going on the actual screen of the hardware device. The likelihood that
the software or the firmware on the hardware device has been compromised is extremely low.
That's one of the things that I've been encouraging through this series that if you get into Bitcoin,
you really should consider getting a hardware device. You don't want to keep your Bitcoin
on an exchange because that comes with a number of risks. If they do go down that route, if
they do venture into getting themselves a hardware wallet, there are a few things they
need to do to protect themselves there. The basics is protecting your private keys. We
know that. In terms of protecting their private keys, there's a number of different ways they
can do it. You've got some famous tests. One of my sponsors right now, Cypher, will have
been through your tests, but you've got these famous tests for testing these devices. Can
you explain what these key management tools are and what you should be considering when
purchasing one? The downside to the hardware devices is that
most people are using them in a single signature setup, which basically means all of your keys
are on that one device. This, of course, is a single point of failure. If the device screws
up for any reason or gets destroyed, then you've got a problem. You have to make a backup
of basically the seed phrase data that is used to generate all of your private keys.
This turns into a huge question of, well, how do I keep that safe? How do I make sure that
it doesn't get destroyed? I've done a number of tests on various metal devices that are
meant to withstand natural disasters, and it's not necessarily intuitive which ones
are actually the best. In my experience, it's not necessarily the most expensive ones that
are the best. I've got a whole website that's dedicated to me testing both heat and acid
and crushing and how well these devices hold up to those different forms of stress.
I'll share that out in the show notes so people have access to that. If they're not totally
aware, what we're talking about here is when you set up your wallet, you are given a number
of seed words, a number of words that you need to store in order to restore the wallet
should you lose it, should it be damaged. These devices tend to come with a piece of
paper inside where you could write that down. If you write that down and you hide it away
in your house somewhere or at a friend's house, a piece of paper is easy to lose, easy to
become damaged. What these devices do, they allow you to actually, usually with little
kind of metal letters, is actually recreate all the seed words in the device itself.
Now, are there any best practices about how many of these devices you should have, where
you should store them, any advice on that?
Yeah, so this is where things start to get complicated and you once again have to decide
what you're trying to protect yourself against, but even with a standard seed phrase, if you
put it on a metal device, then a physical attacker that gets a hold of that would be
able to sweep all of the funds from your wallet. You can, of course, create multiple copies.
You can create as many copies as you want, but then you have the security aspect. You
now have to start thinking about physical security again, which is a fairly well-known
problem, but if you're trying to make it so that a physical attacker can't sweep the funds
off the device, then you have to do one of a few things. An easy option that a lot of
people go with is they just add a passphrase to their seed, which is generally supported
by these hardware devices, but that basically means that the seed phrase requires all the
words you wrote down plus some other passphrase in order to actually derive the keys. Now,
the problem then is, well, where do you put the passphrase? How do you back that up? It
kind of turns into this never-ending Sisyphus cycle of things that you have to keep securing.
What I like more than that is just splitting up your keys. Then there's a couple of different
ways to split up the keys. There's one thing called Shamir Secret Sharing, which never
really had a good standard until recently. Actually, Trezor has created a standard around
that, though I'm not aware of a ton of people that are using it yet. Another option is to
use something called Multi-Signature, which is where you basically create a wallet that
is comprised of multiple different seed phrases and multiple different devices. That allows
you to securely have multiple different sets of keys in different locations so that even
if one set of keys gets compromised for any reason, that attacker will not have enough
data to actually sweep the funds out of your wallet. You start going down a whole rabbit
hole here, and ultimately you get to the level of what we've done at CASA, which has resulted
in basically a 40-page long document around all of the threat vectors that we've thought
through and how we mitigate them all.
Yeah. What I would say right now is that people listening might be thinking, God, this sounds
so complicated. There's so much to do. But really, I think what we should say is that
your privacy processes and your key management will develop as you go down the Bitcoin rabbit
hole. You might buy your first few dollars, $50, $100, and actually keep that on an exchange,
which isn't best practice but isn't the worst scenario in the world. But maybe you buy some
more and it grows to a few hundred dollars or a thousand dollars. And at that point,
you maybe get your hardware wallet and you transfer it to that. And then you just start
investigating ways to manage your private keys. But I would want to say that people
should be too scared off by this. It's like a learning process, right?
Well, yeah. I mean, it's really no different than securing anything else of value where
the level of value that you're trying to secure will dictate how much resources and time you
put into trying to secure it. So people don't put a ton of resources into securing their
wallet that they carry a hundred dollars around in. If you lose that wallet, then it's not
a big deal. It's not the end of your life. And that's the same way that I tend to operate
with my spending wallet of Bitcoin, my hot wallet on my mobile phone. It's only a few
hundred dollars. It doesn't need to have an amazingly high level of security. But ultimately,
if you have been in the space long enough, if you're a really long-term holder, then
you may have a significant fraction of your net worth in Bitcoin. And that's the point
at which you start to think about all of these really crazy attack vectors that are highly
unlikely, but because they would be catastrophic to you from a financial standpoint, you start
to entertain even the slight likelihood of a crazy scenario happening and how you might
be able to mitigate that without too much trouble.
One thing we should talk about here, that is something that's happened quite a bit,
it's happened to quite a few people, is SIM swapping. Can you explain what SIM swapping
is and what people can do to help prevent against that happening?
Basically it seems to be an American problem, but the problem is that the cell phone companies,
at least in America, have made it incredibly easy for someone to take control of your phone
number and basically swap the ownership of your phone number over to a different device.
Now maybe this is happening because people are social engineering the companies themselves,
but I think in many cases, it's happening because employees at the companies are getting
bribed to do this. And so if we assume that the company and employees at the phone company
are compromised, then we should not use a phone number as a security mechanism for anything.
And that basically means on any of your online accounts don't have SMS based two factor authentication,
don't allow for account recovery based upon SMS if that's an option at all, and really
preferably don't put your phone number in any online accounts is probably the safest
way to go about that.
I mean, yeah, every time I access my Gmail, it keeps popping up with a little pop up saying,
would you like to add a backup phone number? And no, I don't. I used to have it on there.
But again, after our previous session, I went through every service I had and removed my
phone number from it. And also this comes back to your other point, whereby if you're
talking about Bitcoin and you're being public and you're leaving bits of information everywhere,
it might be quite easy for someone to find out what your phone number is and which service
provider you're using.
Exactly. And so really like the only way that I've been able to really solve this problem
is to not even know my own phone number. So my phone that I'm using regularly has a SIM
card that I purchased anonymously with one of those throw away online credit cards, throw
away name, et cetera, et cetera. And so they don't know the identity of me, the SIM card
holder. I don't know the actual phone number that is tied to the SIM card. Then when I
have to give out a phone number, I use this other proxy service that essentially forwards
to the real phone number. And that allows me to actually create many different phone
numbers so I don't even have to give out the same virtual phone number to all the different
providers and different classes of people that I'm interacting with.
But this is once again kind of going down a deeper rabbit hole. For most people, if
you don't want to go to all of that trouble and you're in the United States, I would say
the most secure mobile phone provider that I'm aware of is Google Fi. And to date, I'm
not aware of anyone on Google Fi ever being SIM swapped. And that's what I was using for
a number of years before I went down this alternative, more complicated path.
Well, that's a pretty good recommendation. I think we should also say that we're not
saying to people that you shouldn't use two factor authentication. We're actually saying
the opposite. You really should be using it. But you should be using a tool like Google
Authenticator and always in every scenario avoid using SMS two factor authentication.
But some people might not even know what two factor authentication is. So should we explain
what that is?
Yeah, I mean, it is exactly what it sounds like in that it is a second factor. So you
know, your first factor of authentication is generally going to be your username and
password. So that's something that you know, you can then use a number of different tools
for a second factor, you know, in on on many phones, there may be some sort of biometric
two factor authentication to get into various apps or unlock things in the operating system.
For web based services, for a long time, SMS was the default, we seem to be moving away
from that. But you can do something called T OTP, which is time based one time passwords.
Usually people use Google Authenticator as a mobile app to manage those. It's basically
the 30 second rolling six digit codes. What's even better though, is actually using dedicated
hardware once again. So just like we recommend dedicated hardware devices for your Bitcoin
wallets, I also recommend dedicated hardware devices for your two factor authentication.
Really good one is the YubiKey, which supports both the U2F standard, and even can also support
the the rolling code passwords via the YubiCo Authenticator app. And in that way, you're
actually not storing those keys on your mobile phone anymore, you actually store them on
the YubiKey itself.
Another thing people can consider when going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole is running a
node is something they're going to learn about early on, it might be a bit intimidating.
But what are the benefits of running a node? And how does that help support privacy?
So I kind of see it as two different tiers of operating on the Bitcoin network. The first
one being holding your own keys, that gives you the first real level of sovereignty. You
know, if you hold the keys, no one can take your money, only you really control your money.
But then the question becomes, you know, what is your money? What what is the the state
of the Bitcoin network? And that's where you get to this second level of sovereignty, which
is validating everything that's happened on the Bitcoin network yourself, to make sure
that nobody is breaking the rules. If you aren't validating the history of all the transactions
on the Bitcoin network, then essentially, you're trusting someone else to validate them
for you. And in many cases, that may be okay. A lot of people use SPV wallets, which kind
of have a minor based trust model that that you know, the majority of miners are being
honest and so on and so forth. And there's trade offs to all of these things. But running
the node not only gives you that level of security that the rules of the network are
being followed, it also allows you to query your node directly for you know, the transactions
and balances that are related to your wallet. And and this is something that I think very
few people are doing. And and as a result, they're they're going out and their wallet
software is you know, querying some other servers, some other nodes. And and basically
saying, you know, you know, give me any transactions and any balances related to all of these addresses.
And and this is a, you know, potential like network eavesdropper style, privacy leak,
because you don't necessarily know what servers out there that you're connecting to, what
nodes you're connecting to, and who's operating them. I mean, it's practically guaranteed
that a decent number of nodes on the network are probably being operated by companies like
chain analysis that are, you know, trying to identify wallets and and users who own
those wallets. So, you know, if you are doing that, then at the very least, you probably
want to be doing that through a VPN or through Tor to, you know, try to mask your real IP
address, and you're not correlate your IP address with the addresses in your wallet.
Okay, that's a good segue into internet privacy, because there's a number of things you can
do a number of things I've changed personally, since you know, we did our show, I've talked
about this now. With regards to your PC and your setup, what are the basics that everyone
you think should be using? Would you say a VPN is basic? Would you say tours basic? Do
you think that they are things that people should be considering?
I wouldn't normally say that tour is basic, though. I believe brave has actually done
a great job of making tour basically point and click type of solution. Now, you can basically,
you know, open a tour browser tab very easily and brave. But a VPN is something that I think
most people should be using simply because it is protecting you from exposing your real
home IP address, which it gives away your rough geographic location. It also, you know,
is a fairly unique, like fingerprintable item that can be used to correlate, you know, other
things that you're doing online. So if you're using a VPN, then you're most likely going
to end up being using a shared IP address that has a lot of other traffic going through
it. So that should also help you kind of hide in a crowd from that standpoint.
And the VPN, would you recommend that something that's on the whole time when they're using
their computer or just for specific activity? I would, I would definitely say all of the
time is preferable. But you know, this becomes another issue because people have many different
devices. What I have ended up doing myself is not having the VPNs configured on every
single device, but rather configuring them at the router level. And that way my home
router ensures that all the traffic that is going out of my home network is going through
a VPN. Unfortunately, this is way beyond a basic level type of thing to configure. I'm
not aware of any off the shelf retail consumer network routers that make it easy for you
to set up a VPN at the router level. Yeah. And one of the things I've found is, you know,
I have a VPN on my computer, but with certain services won't work. For example, Netflix,
Netflix won't work if you're using a VPN. So I tend to find I switch in and out for
when I use it. But I also actually have a VPN on my phone now. I've actually started
using that. I'm guessing you would recommend the same.
Definitely. The one downside that I have noticed is that it's going to drain your phone battery
a lot faster. Because essentially what a VPN is doing is it's encrypting and decrypting
all of your traffic at an additional layer, you know, on top of the web browser level
and encryptions that are already occurring. So it basically has, you know, additional
computational load that it creates. And whether that's on your phone or your laptop or your
router, that also can potentially slow down your traffic. If you need really, really high
throughput downloads, then you would probably notice a difference if you're doing it through
a VPN. Okay. One of the most important tools that
I've brought into my setup is to use a password manager. You know, one of the big problems
is a lot of people reuse passwords. They might have one they use for everything or one they
use for general websites and another one they use for maybe their bank. But one of the main
issues is that if a service is hacked, the hackers tend to brute force use those logins
and passwords on multiple websites to try and access them and try and access your information.
So I've introduced a password manager. Do you recommend the same? Do you recommend people
introduce a password manager? And is there specific ones that you particularly like?
Yeah, I mean, the way that I put it is that you should not know any of your passwords
other than a master password to open up your password manager. Additionally, your password
manager should be once again, secured by two factor authentication and preferably, you
know, hardware to factor authentication. A number of people don't like it because it's
not open source. But I've had a pretty good experience with last pass because it has a
ton of these features. It also makes it really easy to use across different devices, you
know, both desktops and mobile phones. And, and it supports the Yubi keys, it actually
supports I think half a dozen different types of two factor authentication. I believe some
other good ones are like one pass and key pass. I'm not as familiar with how good they
are at the like cross device, automatic syncing, though that's, that's one of the main, I think
detriments to a lot of the the open source password management software is keeping them
working across all of your devices and in sync without having a lot of overhead.
The one I'm a particular fan of is Dashlane. That also supports multiple devices, you know,
laptops, mobile apps are very well. Have you much experience with that yourself?
No, I can't say I've tried that one.
Yeah, pretty good, pretty good. Alright, so listen, that we've covered a lot here, Jameson.
There's a lot for people to take in here. I think almost in some ways people can be
a little bit overwhelmed here. But if we, if we sink it down to the absolute basics,
when somebody was getting into Bitcoin, now what are the absolute things that you would
say that you should definitely do straight away?
The most important things that you can do are the the free ones really is, you know,
the the things that don't require anything other than time and effort to set up. So you
know, setting up your your ad blockers, setting up password managers, which in many cases
are free, though, you know, you might want to pay, you know, a small like 10 or $20 a
year subscription to get additional features and syncing and whatnot. And then, you know,
depending on how much value you're putting in it, if if we're talking more than a few
multiples of the cost of a dedicated hardware device, then it starts to make sense to looking
into one of those. And the really tricky thing, I think about Bitcoin is that there are so
many different pitfalls, we can't possibly cover all of the things that could go wrong.
Like I said, we have a 40 page paper with a lot of the things that can go wrong on the
casa website. But most of this is really just a matter of time and research and how much
you put into like thinking about how to protect yourself. And the, you know, the unfortunate
thing is that nobody is going to beat you over the head and make you protect yourself.
And so in many cases, I think what happens is people are lazy, and they they do that
the absolute minimum just to get things working. And they don't think adversarially about all
the things that could go wrong. And then things go wrong. And they learn the hard way. And
hopefully it isn't so catastrophic that it completely puts them off to, you know, the
entire space in general. But I think you would be hard pressed to find someone who has been
in the Bitcoin space for many years who hasn't had a few stories of things going horribly
wrong. You know, we all learn the hard way, one way or another. I think the most important
thing is to try to ensure that when those unforeseen events happen, that they aren't
completely catastrophic.
Yeah, one of the things you can do is you can create that personal plan. They could
especially they can dig up your article or medium that I'll put in the show notes. And
you can just sit there with a piece of paper and a pen and work your way through and say,
these are the important first steps I'm going to take. I usually say to people, look, get
rid of the Google apps, download Brave, have a VPN and have a password manager. I always
think that's a very good first few steps. And then in terms of your Bitcoin, you know,
go to a hardware wallet and have a very good key management solution. And also just be
very careful about how and when you start spending your Bitcoin. I always feel that's
like a very good basic start. But then I always say to myself, like I said, I have a James
and Loppie sits on my shoulder and everything I do, I always just have a double think is,
is this a bit of information I need to give? You know, what information should I provide
in? Am I doing anything stupid? But I think I don't think people should be overly concerned
to begin with. They should just develop, like you say, that personal plan for you. And then
probably, what, review it once a year?
I would say it's something that you need to review whenever circumstances change. And
so, you know, from the, from the Bitcoin standpoint, it's usually, you know, has awareness gone
up significantly? Has the price gone up significantly? The, the way that I try to give people perspective
on like, what is the appropriate level of privacy and security is that, you know, if
you look at the, the volatility of the space, not just from the price standpoint, but general
awareness is that we can very easily, you know, do an order of magnitude change in just
a few months time. And if you only set up an appropriate level of security and privacy
for like what the current level of Bitcoin mainstream awareness is, then you're going
to get caught flat footed when there's some major event and, and all of a sudden there's
a lot more attention on the space. And so I kind of try to, to frame it in terms of,
you know, bubbles, essentially of like, you want to be prepared for the next bubble happening.
You don't want to have to scramble and, and make a bunch of changes, you know, as the
bubble is occurring and as, as everything is, is going crazy. Like you want, you want
to be prepared in general. And you know, I think that that's why we actually have a number
of people in the space who are, you know, kind of a prepper mindset, not just for Bitcoin,
but for life in general is that I think a lot of us have that adversarial perspective
where we're thinking about the edge cases and the things that probably won't go wrong,
what could go wrong. And, and once again, we're just trying to create our own insurance,
if you will, you know, mitigate some of these things so that if, if, if the outside event
that we don't think is going to happen actually does happen, that it won't be as terrible
for us as it would have been if we were completely unprepared.
All right. Well, you've talked about costs for a few times in this interview. It's a
company you work at a company you work for. Do you want to just explain who they are?
So if people are listening, they want to find out a bit more information about them, if
they think it might be useful for them. Yeah. So I've worked in Bitcoin and specifically
private key management for over five years now and have, have seen, you know, a lot of
things go wrong. I've seen people shoot themselves in the foot quite a few times. And I basically
had issues with my own personal cold storage setup. It was just so complicated. And really
what we have been focused on at Casa is helping people improve their own sovereignty. This
is kind of a tricky position to be in because the only way to have the ultimate level of
sovereignty and privacy is to do absolutely everything yourself. But that comes with an
extremely high learning curve. And you basically have to be willing to turn that into your
full-time job. And what we're trying to do at Casa is to help guide people down the path
of basically helping themselves. You know, we don't want to be the custodian and fully
responsible for other people's coins, but we do want to be able to facilitate them getting
into a secure position of self custody. So this is how we ended up creating this multi
SIG key management application that I believe combines both really, really good user experience
in a mobile app, along with the security that you get from both these hardware devices that
we've talked about and from just redundancy and splitting your keys up across multiple
different geographic locations. But, you know, I've basically tried to architect a self custody
solution that is as easy to follow as basically, you know, tapping through a mobile phone app
and following the instructions in the app. So, you know, people who have a decent amount
of wealth in this system and don't feel like they have the time or the technical sophistication
to think through the ultimate level of security and robustness, I highly recommend that they
check out some of our materials on our website and give us a shot.
I agree. I recommend everyone checks it out. Well, listen, James, it's always a pleasure.
Love having you on every single time. I'm going to put all the previous shows we've
done in the show notes, and I'm going to put a few links to some of the materials that
you've provided online, specifically your medium article. What was it titled again?
A modest privacy protection proposal.
That was it, a modest privacy protection proposal. So I'll put that up there. I mean, it's pretty
detailed, but there are some really useful things in there. So yeah, appreciate your
time. Hope everything's well, and hopefully I'll get to see you soon at some point.
Great. We'll see you soon.
Okay. How good was that? Jamison. He's such a beast, man. When it comes to privacy, I'm
not set with Bitcoin. There is nobody out there. You can trust more. There's nobody
more knowledgeable. He really knows his shit with this. And while I'm sure everyone takes
this as far as Jamison does, knowing these privacy trade offs and best practices are
crucial. So I hope you enjoyed this one. And as I said in the intro, Jamison has a whole
set of amazing resources on his website, lop.net. Make sure you check it out. And if you did
feel a bit overwhelmed, don't worry. Just take it step by step. Start with some basic
practices, create a plan that works for you. And then as you go down the rabbit hole, this
will evolve. If you've got any questions or feedback, feel free to hit me up. My email
address is hello at whatbitcoindid.com. And listen, if you want to support the show, if
you want to do anything to help me, it's all up on my website. Head over to whatbitcoindid.com,
click on the support section. Everything is explained there. As I said, this trip is coming
to a close. I had an amazing couple of weeks in South America, filming down in Chile, Colombia,
Venezuela and El Salvador. Those are going to be turned into mini documentaries soon.
So I can't wait to get that out. But yeah, I'm going to be heading back to London in
a few days. Cannot wait. I'm missing my kids. But yeah, another amazing trip. Anyway, have
a great week.

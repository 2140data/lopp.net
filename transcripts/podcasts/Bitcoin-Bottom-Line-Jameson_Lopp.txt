All right, everybody, welcome to the Bitcoin Bottom Line.
I'm CJ Wilson with Stephen McClurg and Josh, though, I guess, what do we call you, Josh,
the the metrics wizard or the analyst crypto historian is also crypto historian.
OK. And today we're we're joined by a crypto luminary.
So he's so bright.
His background so bright that he actually looks like he's in a scene from The Matrix.
Jameson Lopp, who is one of the foremost experts in Bitcoin security and some of these
technical models that we as Bitcoiners need to be aware of.
So, Jameson, thank you for joining us today on the Bitcoin Bottom Line.
You bet. Happy to join you from my anonymous white void.
I love it. It's like I heard you talk one time and you were you were explaining that
anonymity is a huge model in security.
So the the downside really of being like a big Twitter personality or big Bitcoin
personality is people know who you are.
So in order to combat that, you have to sort of like obfuscate your trails around.
Right. Can you talk about that a little bit?
We just jump right into it and then we can talk to some of the other security models
behind your your process.
Yeah, I mean, a large part of it is just trying not to leak any information about
where I am, where I'm going, more physical security related stuff.
The the pieces of my operational security that tend to be extreme are mostly
government related stuff, like so any public property, anything you own that is a
publicly registered thing, an asset like a vehicle or land or house or whatever.
That's where it gets really tricky and very jurisdiction specific to make sure that
your name doesn't end up on those public records that are very easily searchable.
But then going beyond that, actually, the easier stuff is just trying to break any
ties between your name and other various online activities that might somehow then
be correlated to rough geographic location.
But it's it's a whole field unto itself.
And I generally tell people if they're interested in going down that rabbit hole
to just buy Michael Bazel's Extreme Privacy Guide, I think the fourth edition just
came out a month or so ago and it's close to 600 pages and it seems to add 50 to 100
pages every year. So it's it's not getting any easier, that's for sure.
Yeah, I think like as a as a I guess I would call you a celebrity in the space, right?
I mean, you're you're always talking at the let's say Bitcoin 22, 21, whatever
you're at these on. You're on stage sometimes doing these things.
So people sort of know where you're at.
How much is that has your willingness, I guess, to to just make public appearances
and stuff changed over the years? Or is it just like your skill level has gone up
about kind of Batmanning in and out of situations?
I'm definitely a lot pickier about public presentations and things that I go to.
And yeah, I did go to the Bitcoin 22 conference.
That was the first one I have been to in over two years.
Of course, there was the whole pandemic thing, but I'm getting a ton of requests now.
The things are opening back up and I'm turning pretty much all of them down
because it's one of those things where you're you're you're marketing yourself
as being in a specific location at a specific time in the future.
So that could definitely be used against you.
Well, we certainly are glad that you are at Bitcoin 2022.
We were all there. It's good to see you there.
Don't get to see you much, but
but I think it's been twice in one year and I won't say where the other place was.
But but given that, you know, what you guys do at Casa,
you do have physical locations, different places.
You help white glove people onto your platform.
I'm a client, full disclosure.
And so so so how does that work exactly?
And how do you guys kind of protect the business
while you're trying to protect your clients at the same time?
Well, I mean, the most important thing is that we architect these setups
so that there's no single point of failure, and that includes Casa as a business.
Now, we have been a remote company since inception.
We do have a handful of physical like co-working locations,
but they're not publicly disclosed.
It's not something you can find on a website or through any sort of
people finder or business directory, anything like that.
So it would be very difficult for a physical attack
against like multiple Casa employees to happen.
But most importantly, we have to assume that a physical attack
against Casa employees might happen because
really none of them have the same level of operational security as I.
And some of them are getting there are certainly better than your average
person when it comes to privacy.
But the most important thing is that even if a wrench attack did happen
against myself or the CEO or any high level
ranking person at the company, that there's no way that that could lead
to any sort of loss of funds or compromise for our clients.
And that's the whole point of having a distributed key set up.
So that's the sort of foundation upon which the company is built.
I can sleep well at night knowing that even if a worst case scenario
happened where all of our servers got blown up or seized by the government
or what have you, that that would only be a minor inconvenience for our clients.
And it would not result in them being locked out of potentially their life savings.
So I guess along with that conversation, like when you have different tiers
of clients, right, they're going to have different levels of Bitcoin.
They're going to have different levels of personal security, financial security,
maybe legal entities like shielding legal entities, family trust, things like that.
Has Taproot and the development on Bitcoin in the last, let's say, four or five years,
has that really given you guys more options in terms of how to how to price
the concierge services or whatever?
Because I think that's one of the weirdest things about Bitcoin is, you know,
hey, we want to help you be secure, right?
But we have to advertise that we help people.
And then we also so there's like this weird thing where you have to kind of put it out
there what you do, but then you don't want too many people to know how you do it
or anybody to really know how you do it.
Right. So how do you guys balance out your own internal business innovation with,
like, the innovation that Bitcoin itself allows you to do?
I mean, I would actually say that we're very open and more than happy to talk
about how we do it.
And in fact, on our website, we have a wealth security protocol, which is like
35 or 40 pages of in-depth explanation, essentially of all of the decisions that
went into how we architected the product and using multi-signature aspects of
protocols, using multiple different manufacturers, hardware devices for
managing the keys and then figuring out how to actually distribute them
geographically.
So, you know, we don't want any of this to be a sort of security through obscurity.
An attacker should be able to completely understand our architecture and still not
be able to do anything about it on the on the sort of taproot.
And I guess what you're getting at is a sort of more complex scripting side of
things.
We're definitely we're keeping our ears open with regard to what is being
developed throughout the ecosystem.
You know, one thing that we're very interested in is aggregated signatures
because that provides a really big privacy boost for multi-sig users and
also sort of transaction fee and data size savings.
However, the reason we haven't already rolled that out and the reason we haven't
seen Schnorr rolled out in a sort of general sense is that there's a number of
different ways to do these aggregated signatures.
And unfortunately, most of them are highly interactive, which means that you
basically have to have multiple different signing rounds happening.
However, we are seeing, in fact, just a couple of days ago, a new paper, which
was entitled Roast came out, which was a new way of doing the Frost type of
aggregated signatures, which, my understanding is, should allow you with
one pre-computed round, which I would think that CASA as a multi-sig provider,
where we're helping coordinate that, we would be able to do that ourselves.
And then the user themselves would only have to do one round of signing so that
it would basically be the same type of user experience of what they're seeing
right now.
Otherwise, it would get really onerous and also, when it comes to any of these
protocol changes, we have dependencies, we have software dependencies, we have
hardware dependencies.
So this is one of the trade-offs of us supporting many different manufacturers
for the signing devices.
It gives us additional robustness in the sense that you're not exposing yourself
critically to any supply chain attacks, where there might be some sort of
exploit or vulnerability in one of those manufacturer's devices.
The flip side of that is you are now limited to whatever the subset of
functionality that all of the devices in your keyset can support.
So if we want to roll out some sort of cool new aggregated signature scheme,
but only Trezor supports it, then we're going to have problems with clients who
have a Trezor and a Ledger and a cold card.
So there's a lot of moving parts.
And as a result of that, we're probably never going to be the first early
adopter of any of these technologies, but also we don't want to be a super
early adopter because we want to observe the landscape of what's happening in
the ecosystem and hopefully let other people make mistakes and shoot
themselves in the foot and let us learn from their mistakes.
Yeah, part of that low time preference thing that Bitcoiners are supposed to
have, right?
It's like know what the goal is, but then maybe inch your way there so you're
taking just positive steps the whole way and not opening yourself up.
One of the things that we always talk about, myself and CJ, and then I tell
clients as a Valkyrie, people say, well, wait, don't you have funds that hold
Bitcoin for people and don't you have ETFs and don't you offer all these
services?
Don't you use your own funds?
Why do you use a service like COSA?
Why do you use hardware wallets yourself?
And my answer is always diversification, right?
Different people have different levels of skill.
If you have very little skill, you just go to Coinbase.
If you've got a little bit more, then you might have a hardware wallet or
use a different service.
And some of these services now don't require a whole lot of skill at all.
And then even for our funds, it's people that say, okay, I've got this
family trust.
I've got to report the numbers back to my accountant.
I've got to report them.
Or it's a corporation or it's a fund that has to have statements.
And then some people can only use certain solutions.
Some people like myself, I like to diversify across a lot of different
solutions in case there's a point of failure.
How do you feel about that given obviously that's your business?
What has this week been like as far as have you seen inflows?
Have you seen outflows across?
Just give us your general thoughts on the diversification.
Yeah, okay.
So I think in general, the only reason that I have come across that makes
sense to me for why someone would use a custodian is if they're in a
regulatory position where they're legally required to use a qualified
custodian.
And so we certainly understand that those type of entities are not a fit
for us.
We have no intention of ever being regulated, of ever being a financial
provider.
We are really a security consulting service.
I would say our biggest value is actually giving people the ability to
actually get on the phone with someone if something goes wrong or if
they're not sure what to do.
It's very rare to find that level of service in this space, especially for
self-custody.
Almost all self-custody options tend to be sort of community-based support
or the companies are so huge and retail-based that if you're trying to
get in contact with them and get help, you might be waiting for days or
weeks to get what is probably a templated response that will be really
annoying.
I've run into that myself with a number of different companies in the
space where you can tell that they're outsourcing their support to the
Philippines or something and the support people aren't even allowed to
type their own stuff.
They're only allowed to choose from a drop-down of different possible
answers to any given query.
When it comes to diversification, I think there's logical ways of doing
it and then there's other ways that might feel logical on the surface but
actually be a bad decision.
One of the most common forms of diversification that we see, at least in
the self-custody space, is people buying a handful of different devices or
creating a handful of different single signature wallets and then just sort
of spreading those around.
The idea there is that if any given seed phrase or device or whatever gets
compromised, then they'll have lost some portion of their holdings but it
won't be catastrophic loss of everything.
Our take on that is that what you're doing is you're taking the old adage
of not putting all your eggs in one basket.
That makes sense and you are decreasing the likelihood that you'll have one
single catastrophic loss.
I think what people don't necessarily realize is that that type of
diversification actually increases the chance that you will have some small
form of loss.
The type of diversification that we like to see instead is where you have
one logical constructed vault and the diversification is within the different
security protections around each of the keys that comprise that vault.
Whether that's geography, whether that's the type of hardware that's securing
it, really even then the potentially physical layers of security around where
you're putting it, whether that's in a safe or in some sort of professional
vaulting service that is requiring various forms of authentication to even
enter into the building.
With CASA, we have different levels of authentication that we set up for
requesting signature from the key that CASA holds.
For our concierge level clients, that basically includes doing an audio-video
call with someone verifying various details, giving them opportunities to
provide duress phrases and so forth and basically making sure that everything
is good on their end.
Plus then actually having a multi-day waiting period even after authentication
happens just to once again make a sort of $5 wrench attack scenario less and
less likely or be a higher or higher cost.
We do see a number of people and entities that are diversifying between
self-custody and third-party custody.
I think that does make sense as well in certain situations and I myself am in
that situation where while I self-custody the vast majority of my funds, I
also have funds that are spread out between various services and that are
providing me with other functionality.
Sometimes that comes in handy.
It actually came in handy this week when I got a margin call on one platform
and I was able to authenticate myself and instruct them to move some funds
around without me then having to spend a whole lot of time going around to
geographically distributed keys to actually make an on-chain transaction to
move extra collateral into that service.
I think that's where Lightning really works really well.
If you have an emergency Lightning wallet, theoretically you can move things
around from the exchanges that are actually willing to process Lightning
transactions so then that helps you a little bit.
Obviously there's some super out there Bitcoin or hardcore things like you
could have an open dime or something like that if you really needed to do a
combination of a physical and a quick one-way transaction or something like
that but I think the thing that freaked me out was as we had the price dip, the
mempool gets clogged up because people start moving coins around and then some
people are going to be getting margin called and won't be able to get there
depending on what the length of time between the margin call and the actual
action is.
That's really where there's I think still a little bit of immaturity in the
Bitcoin space for that because like you said if you have to chase things around
that's a time delay and if you have a time crunch we have to figure out as an
industry what's the most efficient way of solving that problem and sadly one of
the most efficient ways of doing it is paying by fiat because you could just
sort of call and do a wire if you have to unwind a dollar loan against a Bitcoin
position or something like that but if you have a Bitcoin to Bitcoin thing
sometimes it's way more convenient because it's like one sat per byte or
something like that and you just fire it off at three in the morning on a Sunday
it's no problem but other times you have a mempool clogged in the middle of the
week and you're like oh shit I just have to call a bank and or sell on an
exchange and then get wired the money then wire the money to somebody else or
whatever.
So I think we're still at that phase where we're going to see some of that
stuff developing where you can maybe live completely on Bitcoin but I don't
know if we're totally there yet because you know not everybody is going to have
a lightning wallet with enough money to really handle their day to day spending
you know.
That's how I think so we're getting close one interesting aspect about the
sort of convenience and speed issue with multisig is that in our default setup
we really originally designed it for single individual who was then
spreading their keys out and intentionally making it difficult to spin
that's really as part of the security model if it's hard for you to spend it's
going to be really hard for an attacker to spin.
However one thing that we have noted because you know we have a number of funds
and teams and corporations and such that are using CASA's team product it's
actually faster and more convenient for a multisig where your keys are
distributed amongst many different people for you to coordinate and be able
to create and broadcast an on-chain transaction even in comparison to a
third party custodian because many of these third party custodians are going to
have one or two if not more business day delays between you authenticating with
them to request a withdrawal and them actually processing it.
Whereas in an optimal scenario if you have an emergency where you know you
need to move funds somewhere out of a shared treasury within like five or ten
minutes you can have everybody plugging in their devices passing around the
partially signed transaction and then having a fully completed transaction
that you can broadcast out on the network.
Yeah I think that's where necessity is the mother of invention right so as we
run into these things like I was talking to somebody about it the other day when
you go to buy a house through your shell corporation that's named you know
obscurely with a symbol in there something like that in a random state
that protects you you know trying to stay on theme the contract is very thick
usually right it's like usually there's like all these disclosures and all these
things you have to sign and triplicate because there's been lawsuits for
decades about these different things right and that's sort of the learning
process so by the time someone goes to buy their first house there's been so
many houses sold and so many like you know litigious things that that's why
they have all these things in there so I think at some point you know Bitcoin
transactions or Bitcoin based companies or Bitcoin teams will have will have
like more tools in the same sense right more tools to work with because you'll
have the security assessor you'll have a chief Bitcoin officer for the company
you'll have you know various security protocols that are just sort of de facto
that's just sort of the way people do it once Bitcoin as an asset class either
gets more distributed or more valuable because the stakes are so high right and
I think like guys like yourself that have been really like way earlier had
your vision on it the whole way but new people as they come into this are like
oh hey I have $5,000 with the Bitcoin or something like now what do I do and you
sort of have these I mean maybe you're not engaged at this level but when I've
been in let's say like clubhouse rooms or Twitter spaces or whatever with other
people from Casa and they sort of have this explanation of like okay this is
like how you get there and I think people have the goal of accumulating a
lot of Bitcoin but then it's like they have to have the security from day one
like as a as a guiding principle because otherwise they end up with a bunch of it
and then they have no security and that's really when they're the most
vulnerable right almost like if you buy too much too soon before you're really
you have your personal security and you're you're you know signing devices
and your ability to use all these different devices because a cold card is
much different than a ledger I mean like in terms of the the actual operation
yeah I think the biggest issue is people making the leap from the sort of
traditional brokerage type of system to this new system so what generally
happens is you know someone creates an exchange account and they make their
trade and that's it because that's how every other system works every you know
non crypto traditional financial system they probably don't even understand
that withdrawing is a thing so and the exchanges aren't necessarily
incentivized to to push you towards the withdrawal features so there's there's
definitely a lot of learning that's going to happen that's one of the reasons
that I think this is going to be a sort of generational thing that humanity will
have to sort of absorb over the years and then also because people aren't used
to having the same level of risk of like you know someone logs into your
brokerage account they're probably not going to be able to completely wipe out
your account in an hour or so and you have no recourse and and so for that
reason your people don't understand that the risk is a lot higher and that they
do need to think more about security and and that's how they end up just using
the same poor cybersecurity practices that the vast majority of people are
using we're reusing passwords either not using a two-factor authentication or
using really weak two-factor authentication like SMS based stuff and I
mean I just heard I think yesterday one of the CASA employees posted that they
had a friend who got into crypto a few months ago and had a Coinbase account
and they they were just asking them hey is it possible for someone to clean out
my account because they logged in for the first time at six months and balance
was zero and someone had just withdrawn everything probably because they were
reusing their passwords yeah that's and that's where you need stuff like you
need you need people like Valkyrie or you know CASA or somebody else that is
gonna have some sort of emergency break right and you can have some sort of
human interaction I think that's I think that's what's really interesting is like
Bitcoin has this ability to go really fast and to move huge sums of money in
very quick periods of time but it also has the ability to go real slow you know
what I mean and and because of multisig to force you through these hoops you
know and I think that's one of my favorite things about having a multisig
setup personally is you know like I use exchanges I buy Bitcoin like at various
different places I sort of try to manage my UTXOs I have a mining company I try
to like you know do all this stuff I I think that you can get so complex with
your own security setup that it does get to a point where you might you might be
I want to say like creating a random what's the word like scavenger hunt for
your for your spouse if something happens to you right so in that regard
for someone that has a huge technical setup like how do you manage the the
spouse kids will and testament kind of thing I mean is it like you have the
master you have the master book you know you have like the the post-its that you
got to spin through at the right time and the stars it's like it's all of a
sudden where it's like goonies right you know you got to have the thing and turn
the thing and then like the stars are coming through and you know one-eyed
Willie like falls off the falls off the wheel and then that's how you have access
to your Bitcoin I think it's like we're weird like we we love the analog as
humans and we love the technical as as geeks but then like combining analog and
technical together is like you said it's a generational thing that like the I
don't know I guess I mean technically I guess it's a cypher punk thing right so
to kind of want to do that but I just have this old sort of like steampunk idea
of like you know you have this magic dust you put put over a book and then it
shows you the code to get into the safe to get into the phrases to get into your
wallets to do the multisig you know and hopefully none of that ever happens to
my wife but you know I have to leave like little Easter eggs somewhere for
her to figure it out yeah so you know that that's a case where like
diversification or over complexity is actually a threat this is how a lot of
people have lost a lot of Bitcoin over the years is that they tried to get
cute they thought that they were a security expert and they created an
incredibly secure setup and in fact it's possible to go too far and create a
setup that's so secure that you lock yourself out of it or you lock your
loved ones out of it yeah and really probably twice as much Bitcoin has been
lost due to reasons like that then has actually been hacked and stolen so
that's something to keep in mind is that it is possible to have too much security
and to create setups that are too complicated so that's why we have very
specific inheritance plans that we have standardized and you know work with our
clients on where you know there is a treasure map of sorts but it's a very
simple guide and also you know we're capable of onboarding your spouse or
your beneficiaries into our platform so that you know we can help them out when
the time comes so some of the things that we always tell people that you know
when it comes to security there's there's a few simple things right one
always use you know maybe an authenticator app instead of SMS right
you know that's that's a basic one we also tell people to have multiple
emails you know have have one email that's sort of like your your spam junk
type email that anytime that you're you know you got to use your email to do
something like you know log on at a hotel or something like that which is in
itself a security risk but always always use a you know a spam email but then
always create a another email that doesn't have your name in it for any
financial transaction it doesn't matter if it's crypto bank accounts it doesn't
matter and then you know having two laptops one that's you only do financial
transactions on you know those are some of the basics but but if you have one
piece of advice you know one thing that somebody could do that is they can
protect them and their security what's what's the key thing that you would say
by a you be key and use a password manager that you unlock with that you be
key and then you should not you should only know one password and the only
password you should know is the master password to unlock your password
manager every other password that you have should be randomly generated and
like over 20 characters long that's that's gonna protect you from some of
the most common stuff because you have to assume that every service that you
create a login to is gonna get compromised and that those credentials
might get leaked and then this is something that we see all the time or
really anyone who runs an online service every once in a while whenever there's a
big data leak you your service starts getting hammered with just lists and
lists of all of these leaked usernames and passwords because people are just
trying them they're like you know there's a good chance that at least like
half a percent of these usernames and passwords are getting reused on other
common services so you know humans are very bad source of entropy so you don't
create your own passwords so along those lines though there's something to be
said about the the nature of your passwords in the sense that longer they
are the harder they are to hack right and so some of these some of these apps
or web services or whatever they have like a limit to the amount of
characters you can use or they limit you from using other characters so it's
almost like in a way they're they're broadcasting how they're at some point
going to get hacked because they they have a limit to that they have a top end
limit to their security protocol right so if like I remember a couple years ago
there was like a like an iCloud hack where all these celebrities whose it
would their emails were basically like first name dot last name at me.com or
something like that you know like like no obfuscation of their email at all it
was just literally just first name dot last name and they had their stuff hacked
to the point that their iCloud photos were being put online right and people
were like up in arms they're like oh my gosh there's naked pictures of like these
you know actresses and stuff like that and it's like well you know the whole
point of Bitcoin and I mean one of the great points about Bitcoin is it
obfuscates your wealth so that you can have a ton of money or no money and then
like nobody really knows how much you have at all because if you're doing
everything right then it's always a mystery you know because you don't have
just one huge wallet that's got everything in it that you're like oh I
need to pay for you know tacos so here's like you know fifty thousand sats coming
out of a wallet that's got a hundred Bitcoin in it or more or whatever but I
really think that that like we're at this weird meeting where like the the
there's a lot of plebs that are coming into the Bitcoin and their dollar
cost averaging and they're coming up to a point where they're about to
transition from you know having let's say a million sats to ten million sats
or ten million sats to a hundred million sats or something like that and so
they're getting to that point where they're especially with Bitcoin being
as cheap as it is today and the economy being crazy people are kind of squirting
more money into Bitcoin as they go as they learn more about it and so there's
going to be this really weird like like ramp I think of exploits that happen
because like you said the human is the soft target right if their password is
you know big boobies one two three on every every service they use or like
what's the kid from Kyle from Wisconsin or whatever you know it's like you know
you you have to think about the Bitcoin that you have today could be worth ten
twenty a hundred times what it was today one day and if someone has your password
now then they can get in your email now and then they can you know like stay
with you and and there's there might be a whole benefit for hackers or whatever
else for hacking people today but not exploiting them today because the
Bitcoin is not as not worth as much so I think like that game theory is so
interesting because it's like there's all these things tumbling at the same
time so I think like the more you get into it you get like the sort of
conspiratorial mindset you sit there think like well I really have to take
extra steps you know because otherwise and you know and cut emails off and
stop using that email for everything because if you have one email for like
15 years there's a I mean the longer you have that email the higher the chances
that someone's going to get into it and if you have some sort of reset button or
whatever that they can go through your email to get then you're going to get
hacked at some point right as a person so yeah I mean that's it's good
cybersecurity 101 is treat your email account is actually your most important
account because that's how hackers tend to get into all of your other accounts
you know resetting passwords and whatnot so I would also recommend you know once
you get that you be key use that you be key for everything especially your email
service and then this comes down to you there's like three different types of
authentication there's something you know like a secret like a password or a
private key there's something you are which is like biometrics and then
there's something you have and something you have is is like a you be key you
know a physical device so that you know if you have that form of
authentication nobody out on the internet is going to be able to grab
that and then impersonate you and so that limits your attack surface down
significantly from everybody on the internet to someone who is willing to go
to the extremes of you know physically coming to your location and taking
control of that device yeah well we really appreciate you coming on

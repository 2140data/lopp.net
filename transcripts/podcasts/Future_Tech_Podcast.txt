Welcome to Almost Here, around the corner future technology podcasts with Richard Jacobs.
Future technologies voice to transform our lives, for better or worse, are the focus
of this podcast.
Almost Here means these technologies are now here and starting to be used, or just around
the corner, from Bitcoin to artificial intelligence, 3D printing, blockchain, virtual reality and
more.
Hey, this is Richard Jacobs with Future Tech Podcast.
My guest today is Jameson Lopp, head of the infrastructure team at BitGo, B-I-T-G-O.
Jameson, how are you doing?
Doing well.
Thanks for having me.
Yeah, when I hear your name, I picture a bottle of, I believe, whiskey, so it's a good association.
Yes, I do have a fair amount of Irish in my blood.
Excellent.
All right, well, tell me a little bit about your background and then let's talk about
BitGo, what you guys do there.
Sure.
So, I'm a computer science major, been working for about 10 years now and for the first part
of my career was mainly working in big data, like cloud analytics type stuff for online
marketing and ended up getting interested in Bitcoin and crypto assets.
And after I had been just sort of piddling around as an enthusiast and doing some open
source projects, just trying to better understand the space, eventually it grew large enough
that I realized that I could just go ahead and do it full time since I was already spending
so much of my time trying to understand it better and working on it.
So I've been at BitGo for about two and a half years now and we started out mainly servicing
Bitcoin wallets at the enterprise level, exchanges and remittance providers and really anyone
who is processing large amounts of Bitcoin.
And after doing that for a few years, started diversifying out and these days we support
all kinds of things from Litecoin to Ethereum, Ripple and then even most recently we have
our own permission to blockchain that we developed with the British Royal Mint and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange which is going to be used as a gold trading platform.
Tell me about that.
So it's a private permission blockchain and it's going to be used to digitize, tokenize
trading of gold all over the US or all over the world?
Yeah, it should be all over the world.
There's a number of different institutions that are playing parts in this but the idea
being that people have been trading gold in various ways for really all of human history
and then in the recent 20th century I guess the paper gold trading products came online
and a lot of them have been digitized but while some people are trading the real quote
unquote paper assets like the gold ETFs, there are other people who want to trade the actual
physical gold and be able to call in their ownership of that gold to get physical delivery
of it.
They want to be sure that whatever they're trading is actually backed by real gold somewhere.
And there have been products where people can do that but there's still some trust issues
going on where you have to be trusting the auditability of the physical gold wherever
it's being vaulted.
So the main idea here is that we're just using a blockchain to replace the very low level
layer of the auditability so that the gold will be in the vault at the British Royal
Mint.
So there is some trust there but the British Royal Mint is a thousand year old institution
so it's really hard to get much more trustworthy than that and once the British Royal Mint
has their own audits conducted and published they then allocate a certain amount of gold
onto this blockchain and at that point the auditability really becomes automated.
And you can then use the various features of a blockchain such as running your own node
to verify the entire history of all of the transactions that occur on it.
One of the additional value adds that you get now is that trying to trade these gold
based products currently is kind of tricky because you have to be at a centralized exchange
with other people that are trading that same product.
But now when you're on a blockchain that is more of this global decentralized ledger you
have a new sort of peer to peer trading aspect.
So you're getting a number of different features really added at the low level layer though
of course fundamentally you still are going to have a fair amount of trust with the actual
vaulting institution.
Well in addition to trusting the vaulting institution are they going to do things like
stamp a serial number on each piece of gold and then you can hash that and you can record
the existence of a given piece of gold on the blockchain or is it just going to be depending
on their audits and the blockchain will be used to just make sure that the audit is public
or at least semi public?
Yeah it's really for the latter because once you get it onto the blockchain you can then
subdivide these actual digitized gold into like 10 to the negative 8 or whatever pieces.
So it would be very hard to then just keep track of it with physical serial numbers because
the subdivision and recombination can happen on the blockchain very easily though there
will be you know minimum size amounts if you actually want to call in for a physical delivery
of the asset.
Are you going to try to pull in other players in the gold industry like I talked to Vault
Oro for instance you know they have a vault of gold and they want to digitize it I mean
I'm sure besides the British World Mint there's a lot of other players that they want to come
on board or is it going to be just a project with them to start?
Yeah you know I'm not entirely sure how it would end up working like if other institutions
wanted to get on the same blockchain then we'd have to figure out how we would share
the sort of administrative level permissions I mean I'm sure it's possible you know we're
basically building open source software to enable anyone to do this so actually you can
go to provachain.com to see more about the actual software that we built and it's basically
a fork of Bitcoin and then we added in various administrator permissioning systems to allow
the administrator of the system to do things like allocate and deallocate assets or provision
and deprovision validators on the network or provision and deprovision wallets on the
network stuff like that.
All right well tell me about the other projects that BigGo has going you touched on them very
briefly but let's return to them.
Yeah I mean our primary stuff is all in the you know public permission list crypto assets
space really just trying to service the most valuable most heavily traded crypto assets
out there since really most of our really large customers end up being exchanges we
have you know big incentive to then support whatever assets are being traded the most
and so BigGo's sort of bread and butter if you will is hot wallet security and so like
we all know crypto asset security can be a nightmare because if you get hacked you lose
everything and there's no recourse like there's no you know central administrator to revert
the transaction and give you your money back so you have to be very very careful and paranoid
really with your security so if you want the ultimate security it's very simple all you
do is take your private keys and take them off of the internet you know this cold storage
solution which you probably hear about fairly often and that's great I mean you're taking
cyber security and pulling it into the physical realm that makes it a very solvable problem
because physical security is well known like humans have been dealing with this forever
but the problem becomes then when that's not a solution because you need to be able to
create transactions and you need to be able to you know send these assets back and forth
in an automated fashion in order to make it efficient and make people happy so then you
need to have a hot wallet where these private keys are exposed to the internet and that's
where you know a lot of the disasters throughout the history of bitcoin and crypto assets have
happened where these exchanges have you know millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars
just sitting on servers that are open to the internet so really what we do is we we provide
a multi-signature software product where we're splitting up the keys we use a two out of
three key solution and so we we split these keys up and amongst multiple different computers
so that bit go has one piece of the key the user has one key and then they keep another
recovery key offline as a sort of disaster recovery insurance so this gives us some very
interesting it's still two out of three yeah get into right yeah in order to actually create
a valid transaction in any of these wallets from valid from a network perspective you
have to have two different signatures from two of the three keys which gives you a very
interesting set of properties one of which is bit go is not custodial we only ever have
one key so we cannot unilaterally freeze anyone's money nor can we unilaterally spend anyone's
money and then if you think about like the different situations of you know what hackers
could do if the hacker hacks our user they only get one key so they can't steal the money
if they hack bit go they don't have enough data to be able to steal the money but even
better if bit goes ceases to exist for any reason the user can still go get their recovery
key you have two out of three keys and then completely route around us just use software
to create a transaction to move to a new wallet without ever having to talk to our servers
well that's pretty smart where does the where does the third key the insurance key tend
to be stored well historically the user would always create that themselves but we have
a number of different options we have an offline generation tool or there you can actually
use any number of options to create your own backup key offline you can create it in the
browser which is one of the less secure methods but it's easier for a lot of people and then
of course hold it yourself and then we have a new option that we brought online about
a year ago because we found that you know a lot of users are not technically sophisticated
and do not follow very good IT practices with regards to backing up their data so one of
our default options these days for your standard user is that the key actually gets created
by and stored by a third-party key recovery service that BitGo has no control over so
in that case like if BitGo cease to exist or if we got compromised those recovery keys
are inaccessible to us okay well very good is this this three key setup is this for any
user you know what do enterprise companies tend to do and how do they do it differently
with the key manager yes so we we require two out of three key setup for absolutely
everyone whether it's an individual wallet or an enterprise wallet and then you know
one of the first questions that usually comes up is well what if I want to have you know
multiple signatories you know within my own institution and we actually believe that the
two out of three key solution is best from a cryptographic standpoint because it essentially
allows us to create this model where BitGo is like a co-signer or like an oracle and
so we are in a position where we can then apply any number of arbitrary security rules
or checks on our end so we actually have the ability to then much more flexibly be able
to say you know add a rule that says well you actually need to have like three different
administrators at your institution sign off before BitGo will then sign off so we are
able to add like more arbitrary levels of security for enterprises if they need to do
that it's just not done at the protocol level it's done at the like the BitGo level I got
you and what so what kind of wallets have you you guys have created your own wallets
or I mean I guess you wouldn't be using third-party ones so you've created your own what what
tokens do you support so right now it is Bitcoin Litecoin Ripple Ethereum the Royal Mint and
Gold and then we are currently adding support for ERC 20 tokens like generally and I'm not
entirely sure you know which tokens will end up adding that's you know more of a business
decision but once we have like general token support it'll you know only be a few lines
of code to add each new token after that right especially in the ERC 20 line it should be
pretty easy yep all right so what's going to be happening what projects are going on
to you guys in the next six months or a year what's on the roadmap well there's the interesting
thing about roadmaps in this space is that they tend to get disrupted a lot so for the
past year we were rewriting a lot of our infrastructure to make it easier for us to be able to add
support for new blockchains and you know all of those other non Bitcoin blockchains that
I talked about we just have added on over this current year and you know the token thing
I have no idea where that might lead but also just we've had to deal with all of these forking
situations so you know Bitcoin Cash which actually really coincided with like the segregated
witness support and now the whole segwit 2x fork and these are constantly providing innovative
new challenges for us to overcome for us basically to be able to service the demand of our customers
who want to be able to access these new assets that have basically been airdropped onto them
but you know the the onus is on us to be able to provide software to allow them to do that
in a safe manner so we've we've had to actually expend a fair amount of time dealing with
these completely unanticipated forks yeah definitely do you think atomic swaps are going
to play a role in helping you so you don't have to try to accommodate every coin under
the sun in terms of a wallet yeah someday so like we we just started internally working
on you know payment channel support at a very basic level and then that will also be a multi-stage
process that I expect will take you know a year if not longer but the the final goal
will be that BitGo wallets that are using protocols that can support it will be able
to you know get onto lightning networks and hopefully eventually also be able to then
be able to very easily perform atomic swaps so I know that we get a lot of customer support
requests from people who assume that we're some type of exchange or offer exchange services
and we always have to tell them you know well we recommend going here or there but it would
be great if in the future if we can just have you know a button in the wallet that says
hey do you want to exchange this crypto asset for that crypto asset and then all they have
to do is click a button and put in their password and their two-factor authentication and the
exchange can happen basically instantly without ever having to you know trust a third party
to broker it yeah that's why I asked I'm sure a lot of people are getting more and more
interested in that so it'd be nice to have a wallet of the future where you just you
know whatever is in there you can pick whatever final token you want it to be used as a payment
method and it swaps it internally yeah I mean I think that these payment channel solutions
have a ton of promise of what they will be able to do though they've probably been over
promised a bit by some people you know there's going to be a lot of work at the very low
levels the engineers are going to have to do to make sure that these networks are robust
and then you know the sort of user interface designer folks are going to have to come in
and figure out how to then make it a user friendly experience once the stuff on all
the technology under the hood is robust enough that we can say that you know we're willing
to put this into a production environment and put real money on it all right so what
other project you guys working on we haven't talked about either now or um let's see well
I'm not on the forefront of all the the business deals and stuff that are going on but you
know like I said we are diversifying we diversified amongst the various blockchains that are out
there but one of the major things that we did was diversify into starting to provide
services to build you know custom blockchains for other people so I think that you know
getting the Royal Mint Gold product out there and getting the the Prova open source software
out is kind of another first step where we will continue to be pitching you know various
custom built blockchain solutions generally like for institutions that want some sort
of permissioned based chain so I doubt that Royal Mint Gold will be the last is certainly
not the intention for it to be a one-off thing just really anticipating it becoming
another uh service offering that we add is there are you guys going to take the Royal
Mint's blockchain make a template out of it and can it be used for any ancillary industries
that are similar or even different but just use the same kind of implementation so you
can move on basically and and I would then anticipate that you know as other institutions
come to us and say well we like this but we also want features x y and z that we would
then build those features into the open source Prova software and continue to improve that
make it better over the years make it you know even more feature-rich.
All right well Jameson tell us tell listeners how they can get in touch with BigGo if they
have a you know wanting you guys to work on their own blockchain you know their own private
permission blockchain or if they want to experience your wallets what's the best way to get in
touch?
Yeah if you generally have a need for securing and transacting in large amounts of crypto
asset value and need to protect it from getting hacked definitely check out our website at
bitgo.com and we we do offer individual wallets but we are primarily enterprise focused business
and so we offer some robust easy to use API's and SDK's such that once you integrate with
us to support one crypto asset it then becomes very very easy for you to support many different
crypto assets usually just changing a few lines of code in your API calls.
Okay very good well Jameson thanks for coming on the podcast I appreciate it.
My pleasure.

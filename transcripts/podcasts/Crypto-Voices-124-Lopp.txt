Hey, everybody. Welcome. Welcome here to Show 124 on Crypto Voices. Matthew Majinskas, your
host here from the Baltics. Joined here by my co-host, as always, Alec Harris from Halo
Privacy and in Eastern US. Alec, what's going on, man? Matthew, how's things over there?
You know, hold and steady, hold and steady, my friend, as well as our friends in Ukraine.
So very happy about that. But obviously, crazy times. In any event, let's let's get back to
Bitcoin a little bit for the show. Very happy to introduce our special guest, Jamison Lopp.
Most of you should know him. CASA co-founder, Statoshi, very big privacy advocate, did a great
privacy presentation at Honey Badger a couple years ago here in Latvia. And yeah, all around
cypherpunk. Jamison, thanks a lot for joining us and welcome back to the show. Glad to be back.
Appreciate it, man. So yeah, just wanted to touch base with you, see how things were in the
you know, in the sovereign Bitcoin world. You guys, you know, I follow your CASA updates. You
guys are working hard there. What's the latest going on at CASA? Well, let's see, over the past
few years, we've mostly been making small iterative tweaks to our product, just continuing to refine
the onboarding and maintenance process and ended up overhauling our inheritance program to make it
even simpler, because it was taking a lot of effort to get people onboarded to that. But suffice
to say, this year is going to be a big year, we've got a lot of big projects underway, but nothing
that we've announced yet. And it's, it's exciting for me to, once again, really get my hands into
some of the lower level protocol stuff since for the past few years, we haven't really been
doing anything new at a like technical level, it's really been more focused on our user
experience. But we continue to survey the landscape and see what our clients are demanding
and try to figure out, you know, how can we use the tools that are available to us and
package them up in ways that make them more accessible to the average person. So that's
really what I'd say CASA's main mindset is, is, you know, we don't want to reinvent the
wheel, we don't want to do anything completely novel or exotic, what we really want to do is
just improve accessibility for people to be sovereign in as many ways as possible. And for
the past four years, that has meant helping people basically set up and maintain their
on chain Bitcoin vaults. And over the much longer time period, we expect that the ability
to leverage your cryptographic keys to improve your sovereignty and many different aspects
of your life, like that's the the general direction that we want to see the world go
in and we want to help the world go in by making it easier for people to accomplish.
I would like to actually talk to you about some protocol stuff. So a lot of changes in
Bitcoin, you know, in the last couple of years. But before that, yeah, I remember asking you,
we'll touch as we always do with Alec, we'll touch on some privacy here. But I remember
asking you some of the compromises you might make in CASA on our first interview, which
was I would recommend our listeners check out a couple of years ago just to compare,
for example, your inheritance services or some other services which involve multi SIG,
you know, what would be some of the sacrifices that need to be made there with privacy? And
you said something to the effect of well, the more security you have with with a third
party, even though they're not holding the keys, or all of the keys, so to say, you know,
you're going to make some privacy sacrifices. Is there anything that's changing there? Is
there any way, I guess, not with the legal inheritance type services, but is there anything
in the pipeline where you are planning to be like even more private, let's say, for
the average user while also remaining sovereign? Well, we have a variety of different ways
that you can set up and use CASA. We certainly have clients who are completely anonymous
and you know, they basically create a completely new email address that's not associated with
anything, not associated with their identity. And that's basically what their login to the
app is. And that's how we have all of our communication with them. And the some of the
trade offs that you have there are basically around authentication when it comes down to
requesting CASA to sign with our cold storage key that we're holding. So it's certainly
possible to do as an ongoing thing. You basically will have other authentication methods that
are not our default. Like our default authentication method for our clients is to have an audio
video call where we actually look at the client and talk to them and compare them to our notes
of like what we know that they should look and sound like. But you can do that in other
ways. Like we have the ability to use other like image based 2FA. For example, you can
like take a photo of some object that is meaningful to you and have that be a sort of form of
authentication where you can then show us that object. But you know, obviously it's
not as strong as an actual real time audio video call. It's also possible for you to
set up a sort of do it yourself inheritance. We can help people basically figure out how
they should set up their keys and have backups so that they can be accessible to other people
if they pass away. But that is different from our normal flow, which is really meant to
go through a more legal estate process type of setup, which involves having one of your
keys and like a safety deposit box with beneficiaries on it, adding beneficiaries to your account
with CASA so that we can sign a transaction at their request if they also have proof of
death. And so, you know, there's a million different ways to do self custody. And we're
here to help people figure out like what is the best option for you? What are the different
trade offs that you're going to be making with any given decision? And you know, we're
not here to tell people, you know, you have to do it this way. We're here to help people
and guide them down a path that we consider to be safe because of the million different
paths and decisions that you can make, I would say probably 99% of them have some sort of
flaw. So it's a dangerous space to navigate, especially if you aren't really deep into
thinking about security.
Yeah, interesting. Okay, so actually, you still probably would say for your service,
which totally makes sense in this in line with what we were, I remember talking about
before, and certainly is hugely valuable for so many, I don't know, everyday Bitcoiners,
but certainly a huge part of the business still is the inheritance, like still having
face to face legal side, something like that, where the identity is pretty much known by
CASA.
Yeah, I mean, the short version is that, you know, if you want perfect privacy, you can't
really be interacting with third parties, like, you have to do everything yourself.
So that gets really tricky, because one of the major pillars of CASA is our service,
our sort of consulting. And it really hamstrings us if we don't have a good line of communication
with the client to be able to help them through different aspects of their self custody.
So as your client base, I mean, I'm sure it has, right, but how has it changed since since
you guys kicked off? Is it more sophisticated, less, you know, I could see how there's more
awareness of Bitcoin, but you also have more entrance. And so I just be curious what they
look like now versus the beginning.
Yeah, obviously, in the beginning, when we didn't really have a reputation built up,
the primary clients were your sort of Bitcoin OGs, usually your less technical, long term
holders who had, I would say the like the the general profile was someone who has been
keeping all their money on like one treasurer or one ledger or whatever. And we're deathly
afraid that, you know, that's a single point of failure. And one day they're going to wake
up and they're going to try to spend their money and something is not going to work.
So over the years, though, especially once the pandemic hit, the profile started changing
and we started seeing more, I guess you could call them new coiners come in. Basically,
profile changed to more traditionally wealthy people who didn't know anything about Bitcoin
and they were looking to diversify. And they had at least done enough research to understand
that they wanted some help figuring out the whole self custody thing. And so in many cases,
it was not only us helping them figure out self custody, but also helping them figure
out how to acquire Bitcoin, sometimes like referring to OTC desks or whatnot. And that
has then over, I would say the past year or so changed a bit because we've put more focus
on our gold tier plan, which is the like ten dollar a month, two of three multisig. And
we're kind of trying to push down market a bit more to, I would say, the broader crowd
of anyone who has like more than probably a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin. It starts
to make sense to look into multisig or to spend like a hundred dollars a year at the
very least. You know, if you have a thousand or a few thousand dollars worth, you should
probably be investing 50 to $100 in a hardware device to get your keys off the Internet.
And if you've done that, then the next logical step, I think, would be going from a single
hardware device to a multisig key set that's using that hardware device.
I would imagine you get some customers that are coming to you post incident or post breach.
And if so, what do you see in that space?
Yeah, I'm sure there are some, though usually it's like someone who had money on an exchange
account and their exchange account got breached. And so then it's more of a question of was
it a, you know, if it was a 100% loss, then they may not be coming to us because they
may basically have been knocked out of the game. Hopefully, though, it was smaller forms
of loss or I would say the more common thing that I've seen is not someone who has had
their money stolen, but rather has made a mistake and gotten locked out of their funds.
And so I've helped a decent number of new clients recover funds that have become inaccessible
to them. And sometimes that's as simple as doing some semi-brute forcing of like derivation
paths and like they might still have a seed phrase. They just didn't know what wallet
they used to set it up or what derivation paths or script types it was being used to
store. So in like in those situations, I can often help people recover the funds. In other
situations, sometimes it means referring them to a service that is much more sophisticated
at brute forcing stuff. You know, it really depends on exactly the nature of why they're
locked out of the funds.
So actually, let's put it back then to Bitcoin. And you mentioned you're going to be able
to work a little bit more on changing some of the, perhaps the protocol level things
and as it relates to your service there. But I guess just first, generally broadly, I think
the last time we spoke, it was right in the middle of the, you know, the civil war, as
it's now been called between the big blockers, the small blockers, however you want to say
it. It took four years, but we got a great upgrade in Taproot and we had this, you know,
new, I don't know if new is the right word, but we have the signaling process. Just one
broad question generally about Bitcoin and how it changed and how long it took to get
that Taproot upgrade and how methodical it was and how different Bitcoin has remained
compared to perhaps other projects in the space. Just general kind of reflections. Do
you have any, do you feel pretty, pretty well about how all the upgrade process is going
in Bitcoin and just sort of any reflections there over the last many, many years that
you've been in the space?
I would say my main takeaway is that far too many people are still scarred and battle weary
and I would say the kind of like where we were on the spectrum of like conservative versus
liberal to making changes. The fallout from the fork wars and scaling debates, I think
was that it really pushed the needle to make a lot of people even far more conservative
because they want to avoid having this showdown of like between different major economic players
on the network and brinksmanship and people like trying to negotiate or use political
tactics to figure out how to force changes through the protocol. And so the result of
that is that the Taproot upgrade, I would say as an upgrade, it actually went extremely
smoothly and there was no real contestation between different entities on the network.
Like we didn't have any mining pools, I think put up any objections to signaling and eventually
validating it. But I think what a lot of people may have missed is that the sort of the friction
and the major contests that were happening, they weren't happening out in the public sphere
like they did during the scaling debates. Rather, they were sort of raging on the developer
mailing lists and chat rooms and whatnot. And this is because developers who are at
the protocol level and actually caring and thinking about, you know, how do we activate
stuff on this network that is worth what, like a trillion dollars now? They spent just
a ton of time arguing over the nittiest, grittiest, tiniest little details of the game theory
behind how we might best activate this stuff on the network. And so I don't even remember
the exact thing because it was being argued about like a year or two ago. But I would
say like one of the biggest cruxes of the Taproot activation debate basically was choosing
between like one of two different ways, I think, of how to count how many blocks had
been signaled for something and exactly how to count what the activation threshold should
be. When I was reading through it, I was like, just flip a coin. It seems almost to be the
exact same either way to me. I don't see how there's going to be any major difference
because this isn't even a highly contested thing. I expect that it's going to get activated
pretty quickly, and it did. But now I'm seeing not similar, but I'm seeing other debates
especially around stuff like any Prevout or the Jeremy Rubin's Check Template Verify stuff
of like, I'm getting the feeling that there's even more and more pushback against changes
now. People are getting even more and more conservative, and I'm even hearing from a
number of developers that they feel like this is it. We should just ossify the protocol
and no more changes. I think it's like it's way too early to be talking about never changing
anything again. That's kind of my takeaway, and my biggest fear is that there's been so
much contention a few years ago that a lot of people are still weary of it and don't
want to. They're kind of like in conflict avoidance mode, and even they're so fearful
and wanting to avoid conflict that they're going to extreme lengths of thinking through
game theory of how can we even manage this in a way that will minimize conflict. But
at some point I think there has to be some conflict and debate if we're going to continue
to evolve.
In 2017 when this was... So almost everyone had an opinion back then because the community
was a lot smaller, and so the number of participants tended to be participating because there was
a genuine interest. So it seemed like everyone was involved in the conversation, and my guess
is if there was another contentious debate now, it would seem a little more muted just
because you have so many passive participants that don't really even... And that's fine,
right? That's desirable, but I don't think it would seem as loud, or I guess I'd be speculating
there. So do you think that some of these protocol debates would become more niche as
there are more participants overall in the Bitcoin ecosystem?
Yeah, and also I think we've learned, and a lot of the major industry participants have
learned what happens when they try to take a position and try to force a sort of democratic
method onto Bitcoin. So while only a few of those players I think ever really admitted
that they went about it the wrong way, I think most of them have been sort of put into a
more submissive position where they don't want to even try to expend the energy to go
through a process like that again. And also, I mean, the ecosystem is so much larger now,
like you said, not only just from the bigger diversity of participants in Bitcoin, but
just the crypto as a whole. If you don't like some way that Bitcoin is going, there's probably
another protocol, another network out there that you can go focus on, or you can go build
your own network. There's still no shortage of people creating new protocols and new networks.
Exit is always an option.
A million directions we could go from there and talk about all the implications plenty
of plenty of people do still in this space. It is a very interesting topic. But now that
we did have a successful upgrade with Taproot, you know, just so many interesting, fascinating
pieces have been added to the repertoire of Bitcoin here. As you said at the beginning
of the show, then you might be looking forward to doing some more protocol level stuff with
CASA. I presume a lot of that has to do with the Taproot upgrade, is that correct?
Definitely. So I've definitely been doing a lot of research around this. You know, it
is one of the more common questions we get. And suffice to say, like, Taproot is not what
is most interesting to us at CASA or for our customers. What is more interesting is one
of the things that came along with the upgrade, which is aggregated signatures. And that's
because if you think about it, you know, a lot of our customers are doing either three
of five multisig or two of three multisig. And especially the three of five, I think
is rarer. But that's it's creating a more unique fingerprint on chain. It's taking up
more data and that's costing more fees. And if you have aggregated signatures, then essentially
what you're doing is you're doing your multisig really off chain and you're only really posting
on chain what is essentially a single signature. So that is really what I'm keeping my eye
on. However, it is unfortunately not something that we're going to be able to roll out in
the immediate future because there's not really a set standard yet for how to do this. There's
a couple different projects that are doing aggregated signatures. They all have tradeoffs.
And really the biggest tradeoffs tend to be a higher level of interactivity. And by interactivity,
I mean that you have to do multiple rounds of signing. So for a CASA user who's normally
having to go around to two or three different physical locations in order to add signatures,
if they had to do that multiple times, it starts to become an extremely poor user experience
and it's a lot more onerous. So I'm basically keeping my ears open for the holy grail low
interactivity aggregated signature solution.
Interesting. Okay. So I was actually thinking there might be more there, at least in the
near term. So still, I was just curious what you said at the very beginning of the show.
I don't know if there are any business secrets you don't have to give away or whatnot, but
you said you would want to get more back into the protocol level stuff with CASA. Is there
anything there specifically?
Oh yeah. Well, there's a few other projects, but nothing that we've announced. I also mentioned
Check Template Verify. Really the sort of covenants and on-chain vaulting solutions
are also something that is interesting to us. Now, at the moment, most of these would
require some sort of soft fork. So that kind of also ties into why I'm not pro-ossification
of the protocol yet. I think there's a very large potential design space for what could
be achieved if we had the proper on-chain opcodes to be able to create these sort of
logical branches, trees of potential execution paths for where your funds can go. It can
actually get kind of mind-boggling to think of, and I think it will take a lot of work
to be able to craft the tools to make that user-friendly. But like I said, that's kind
of what CASA is in the business of, is finding the raw, powerful functionality and building
guardrails into it so that the average person can leverage it.
And then there's also a lot of interesting stuff going on with Lightning. CASA is not
a stranger to Lightning. We had, for a couple of years, a plug-and-play Lightning-in-a-box
node product, and we ended up discontinuing that because, well, a couple of reasons. One,
two years ago, Lightning was really just a sort of hobbyist-tinker enthusiast market,
and so there probably weren't more than, I would say, 10, 20,000 people using Lightning.
It was very easy to saturate that market, not a whole lot of growth opportunity. Secondly,
it was extremely onerous for us to support people having hardware running in their own
networks, basically in these unknown environments. We ran into a lot of really crazy edge cases
that we hadn't anticipated with people running their own hardware, and also just very difficult
for our support people to give that same level of support when these nodes were basically
black boxes to us. They were potentially thousands of miles away. We didn't have any sort of
access to them, and it could be very difficult to help users even get us the information
that we needed to help them debug what was going on with their node.
Thanks again to Max, Roma, and everybody over at HODL HODL for the support, and a reminder,
they also organize the very well-run and fantastic Baltic Honey Badger Bitcoin Conference every
fall in Riga. So head on over to hodlhodl.com slash join slash crypto voices. Thanks again,
and welcome back to the show.
So I think probably a lot of our listeners, but just to set the table, know you as someone
who lives in a very extreme version of privacy, and I would recommend your article. And actually,
there's a ton of great resources at lop.net, but I think the article is a modest privacy
protection proposal. And so that goes into great detail about how you did, what you did,
and I think you've given people lots of opportunity to hear it through your presentations. So
rather than revisiting that, actually, one of the things I really like about it is that
I think it acknowledges the difficulty in going through these processes, and it acknowledges
some of the predicate knowledge that you have to have in order to do it. So you either have
to have someone basically holding your hand the whole way through, or you on your own
have to understand things like open source intelligence and data collection and financial
privacy and legal structures and asset protection and liability and insurance, and the list
goes on. And so once you go through that instantiation process, which is painful, I found it very
painful doing it myself. I'm certain my wife would agree. And then having done it on behalf
of other people or helped other people with it, I've yet to find anyone who just thinks
it's a piece of cake. However, the challenge doesn't end at instantiation. And the thing
that I always tell people is, you're signing up for a wholesale change in your life that
has to be sustained basically forever. For as long as you want to continue to accrue
and protect that privacy, you have to live like this. And so that's a little bit daunting.
The other thing I tell people is, actually, after you set things up, it really becomes
pretty easy and you get used to it. But it's not without friction. And there have been
a few things that surprised me along the way that two years in, I hadn't thought of, much
less at the beginning. And so maybe for the audience, if you want to just kind of, it's
been a couple of years for you, what's it like living that lifestyle over time and what
have you discovered in that process?
For example, I actually had to redo everything a couple of years in. And this is something
that I think that I cover in my article is, this is not a set it and forget it thing.
You have to keep monitoring. And so on an annual basis, I actually hire private investigators
to try to hunt me down and use their own open source intelligence techniques to see if I've
had any data leaks. And so I found actually that there was a data leak through a banking
provider. And so that basically connected one of my anonymous companies to my identity.
And that company could be connected to a property that it owned. And so once again, really
had to burn that all down and started all over again. And there were also some other
minor leaks that happened. But there was one minor leak that happened to my credit report
that I caught pretty quickly because I had all my credit stuff frozen and had high alerts
on everything. And I'm pretty sure that I was able to get that expunged. It was another
banking related thing. And I also had through a different provider, they like sent some
mail in my real name to an address that I was living at, even though they knew like
that address was only supposed to receive anything in the name of the legal entity.
But there's always new stuff that comes up. It comes up less and less frequently, but
usually it has to do with some random third party doing something stupid because that's
their normal process and leaking data. But for example, just a few weeks ago, I got a
bit of a curveball. So I don't know your specific situation, but I assume that you have a sort
of pseudonym or alter ego identity that you use to introduce yourself to people that you
don't know or trust. And so I have one myself. And when you want to do that, you don't want
to just come up with something that's completely foreign to you. So I tell people that I do
security consulting. And that works for me because I know a lot about general security.
And I can basically pass myself off as an expert in that without ever mentioning anything
about Bitcoin. And so this is normally fine because most people don't give a hoot about
security. And so they're not really going to ask you more than a few really high level
questions and then they'll want to move on, change the topic. But I ran into a new guy
a few weeks ago and I gave him my line and he was like, oh, that's cool. I actually am
in sales for a cybersecurity consulting agency. And so I was like, oh no, what have I done?
Now I'm going to have to really amp up my bullshit meter and I'm not used to this. I'm
feeling uncomfortable. And he wanted to connect to me on LinkedIn and start a whole thing.
And I realized I'm going to have to put more resources into this other identity of mine.
And so then I went and I spent like half a day actually setting up a whole new company
and website and email and basically a new front for this identity that I've been using.
And I've never had to do that before. And so, yeah, you never know when you might get
a curve ball like that.
And I stopped correcting people at a certain point, but sometimes people will just refer
to me as Mr. Trust because they assume that the identity, so the highest level superstructure
that owns the property we live in is a trust. And so I'll just get called to Mr. Trust and
I'm just like fine. And the first part of the trust is it's a weird word. And so I surprise
people with things that think it's a name. But I agree with you, right? And I actually
tell people social engineering is also one of the predicate skills that you need for
all this. And the closer you can be to your comfort level, and actually you don't need
to stray too far from the truth because it'll be easier to remember, the better. And I actually
find going, so I always tell people you need some privacy excuses, right? So you need some
reasons why you're doing what you're doing that'll maybe evoke some sympathy or empathy
and that you'll meet less resistance. Because if you try to tell people, I'm not giving
you that information and you put up walls, it just becomes a more difficult interaction.
And so having some adjacent reason for the way things are going tends to be helpful.
And I've tried both ways. But the alter ego you're talking about of a pseudonym, I think
I've heard you say you extend that into your neighbors. Is that correct?
Correct. Yeah. So yeah, never, never give my real name or occupation or anything like
that. The only people who who know that are really my family and my like, pre privacy
era friends. And, and really, even the vast majority of my family doesn't know my specific
location. I would say probably five, definitely less than 10 people know where I am at any
given time.
I don't know if you have kids, Jameson that brings a whole other angle. And I had to learn
about something called the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act. And so under that
act, a school can disclose information about their student directory to any third party
they want without consent. And that includes name and address among a few other things.
And so you have to some schools will proactively have parents sign a consent form for that
others don't. So you have to go seek that out. As well as there's something called COPPA,
which I forget what it stands for. But it's the it's an act that basically limits the
amount of personal information that can be collected from someone under 13. But you know,
once you're 14 or over, which is high schoolers, that information just can be collected and
reshared and resold as well. And there's a ton of data leakage that occurs in the education
system, which I wasn't thinking of our kids were super little when we moved and they're
not ton older now, but we're starting to get into that. So I don't know if that's part
of your experience.
Yeah, I haven't had to deal with that, though. It comes up very often. And I, I have not
found a lot of literature out there. Like, for example, the the Bible that I tell people
to go get is the Extreme Privacy by Michael Bazzell. And I don't think he covers anything
related to children.
He doesn't he does pets. So there's something that I recommend that book too, as well as
his OSINT book. Because if you go through both of those, you can kind of understand
the defensive and offensive side of things.
I'm sorry. Again, I get it. Yeah, about pets.
Well, so Mike Basil stuff is all US centric. And so I don't know that's how this applies
in Europe. But in some jurisdictions, you know, when you have a pet, you have to register
that pet or when you buy a pet, you have to register it just like you would, you know,
a vehicle. And so that would usually come with a air quotes home address for that pet.
And so if you want to go buy a dog, you have to think about that, the attribution that
you want to make back to that dog air quotes home residents. And so and there's actually
some some enforcement of this, or there is some scrutiny on it, because people don't
this is for the protection of the animals, right? You don't want them going and being
mistreated or being resold or into, you know, unscrupulous breeding situations. So there's
a reason for it, but it doesn't serve the privacy motive.
So this is interesting, as always, hearing you go off on this Alec, and obviously, having
Jameson here, it's, it's very interesting to hear you guys share thoughts on this. But
obviously, the topic of privacy, and especially like privacy regarding your personal life,
I can imagine it's hard to sometimes even talk about that, as well, because you don't
want to misstep or you want to keep things in generalities, you both have your real names.
As far as I know, that you use from your pre privacy lives, and you have, you know, credentials
that you've built up that you didn't want to necessarily sacrifice. But then you also
have these alter egos, you probably wouldn't recommend even that for that process for most
people, right? Because if you don't have a podcast, or you're not around, like you wouldn't
even want to do that.
Well, yeah, and this is also why I've gotten a lot of pushback from some more, I don't
know, angry or toxic people online, who are like, Oh, that Jameson guy is not a real cypher
punk, you know, if he was a real cypher punk, he he would be using a completely anonymous
handle, and wouldn't be talking about all of this stuff. And, and I think I'm pretty
open with the fact that I'm not taking the easy path, like the easy path is, of course,
you know, not using your real name or identity. But it was, it was a little too late for me
there, like I had already built up a pretty big reputation with my government identity,
and I didn't want to throw that out the window. So that's why I took the more difficult path
of trying to protect my sensitive government identity. And you build up all of these different
proxies basically around various aspects of my life. But yeah, for for someone who doesn't
have, you know, public persona reputation that they want to continue, then yeah, I would
certainly would recommend a very different path of how to go about protecting your life.
It's going to be all consuming. And I always tell people at least a few times you will
want to quit for sure. Because you're going to be tired, and you're going to be moving
and you're, you know, just going to want to order a pizza, and you're not going to want
to have to, you know, make an identity to do that. And it's going to be annoying. And
that's probably the least of your worries. So I wanted to get into, and I'm not sure
to the extent you're tracking this, but there are some regulatory changes in the US that
would require disclosure to FinCEN, the ultimate beneficial owner of any US registered entity.
So in the privacy world and in the asset protection world, you can set up an LLC, or you can set
up a trust, or you can set up a hierarchy of, you know, asset protection structures to limit
or fully shield the ultimate beneficial owner, which would be like you or me or whoever is
buying a house or owns an asset from what is on public record. And so what the government
is saying is, you know, no more of that, because we're too much of them, there's too much risk
of money laundering and criminal activity there. And so we need to know who is behind
everything. And I think everyone on this conversation would agree that a government registry is
not where you want to be. So are you tracking that? And what are your thoughts on maintaining
your structures? If that passes?
No, I can't say that's actually come up on my radar. What, I guess, would you say is
the the current feeling on like how, how likely that is to go through?
My favorite privacy attorney, Doug, who is of a like mind with all of us here says that
he's pretty confident it is going to happen. And I know he's working on some ways to mitigate
it. But the current, the current mechanisms, probably what you did, what I did, what others
have done wouldn't work in this incend disclosure scenario. And so, yeah, it's gonna be a challenge.
But what we pay lawyers a lot of money to do is to find loopholes. So we can only hope
that they'll find some other loophole.
This is not the first challenge of dealing with government entities in this process,
right? Because you have to have a driver's license or most likely do, right? And you
pay taxes. And so there are certain things. And, you know, if you happen to do this for,
you know, more than 10 years, you're going to go through a census. So this is not new
to the process. But this is a new wrench, I would say.
Yeah. And that's why, you know, I have my address that is like my real address, you
know, for driver's license and other purposes. But I'm actually not spending much time there.
It's really more from my perspective about protecting the physical locations of the places
that I'm spending significant time.
Good news to that, because I know, you know, that comes with logistical challenges, too.
And I'm sure you're probably using adjacent towns or, you know, there's driving involved.
That gets old. I have just one more question on this. You know, we can put it to bed. But
have you found that there are well-intentioned third parties that are risks to your setup?
And if so, how do you deal with those?
Yeah, I mean, they all are. I mean, I've had issues even with family members. So, you know,
for example, like I've the few family members who I've had, you know, come to my home. I've
had, you know, one of them start mailing just like birthday cards and letters and stuff.
And you know, I had to be very strict of like, look, you do not send anything to this address.
That's why I gave you this private mailbox that is not at that address. And then there
were other times when just due to the complexity of like, I've set up multiple mailboxes in
multiple places. And sometimes people who send me stuff get confused. And I even had
a good one recently, just a few months ago, I think I may have like ended up losing a
Christmas gift because of this. But I sent a package to a family member from some like
random UPS store or something. And they took the return address, which I guess was that
UPS store and sent a package back to it. But I don't have an account or a private mailbox
or whatever at that UPS store. So I think that package just got black hold.
Yeah, you have difficulty unwinding things sometimes. So maybe we'll pivot into some
Bitcoin privacy stuff. But I so when you were talking, I was reminded of and this was probably
a mistake. I might do this differently the next time. But we did not go in pseudo or
use a cutout when we were buying the house. So the builder and both the agents knew my
wife and me at the time. And so we sat him down and talked to him about this process
and how important it was to us. And they of course all nodded, right? All three of those
people then within 30 days, you know, put us on their like realtor mailing list and
signed up for third party warranties for appliances in the house. And, you know, set up like a,
you know, some gift subscription in our names. Oh, yeah, it's all of the common marketing
stuff. Yeah. And this is like this is after sitting there, you know, in the like, being
built kitchen, telling them this is really important to us. This is what we're going
to do. You know, we're going to go through this process together. And they're all like,
and these are good people, right? These are not bad people. But the if you rely on bull
whose job it is, or whose job isn't to like necessarily understand this and for whom this
is very foreign, the likelihood of a mistake is really high. Yeah. Well, the the only thing
I can really recommend there and what has worked for me. So like I said, first time
I went through this, I had a few leaks. Second time I went through it. One of the major things
I changed is literally every person that I dealt with, whether it was a realtor, banker,
contractor, anybody. Most of the time, you know, whenever it's possible, I give my fake
identity. So for most contractors, they don't even know my real name. And so I think that's
easier. You know, there's no real friction there. Like, go ahead, leak whatever you want.
It's all made up. But for the few who I have to give my real identity to now, I don't even
start a conversation with any of those people without putting a nondisclosure agreement
up. I'm like, look, you either sign this nondisclosure agreement, and you were going to remember
it because it tells you what's going to happen if you leak any information, you're going
to remember the consequences and you're going to think before you you do any of your normal
data manipulation stuff, or I'll just go find somebody else to handle my business. So basically,
what I'm understanding from this is Jameson, when you said you got in contact by accident
with a security analyst in the business, and you didn't want to go down that rabbit hole,
that was actually Alec, wasn't it?
Please could be. I would have been more respectful as well. But that's it's always interesting
to hear you guys thoughts really deep down in the rabbit hole, which I'm sure and I know
obviously goes goes much deeper than than this that we've been talking about. But look,
we're getting close to time here. I know you got a hard stop, Jameson in a couple minutes.
Should we pivot back to Bitcoin privacy? I don't know, should people be coin joining?
Congress is going crazy on KYC AML, among other things, you know, in the developed markets,
if you're if you're just buying and selling Bitcoin, should you waste? Should you spend
your time coin joining?
Right? This is tricky, right? So first of all, Bitcoin privacy is really, really hard.
But privacy is not a binary thing either. So the question whenever you're talking about
privacy or security is what's your threat model? What are you actually trying to protect
yourself against? And I think most people don't need to be worrying about like having
to coin join their funds constantly. I think like for the average person who is using Bitcoin,
why might you want to use coin join? I think the reason you would want to use it for the
average use case is if you're sending money on chain to someone, and you don't want them
to be able to just go to a block explorer and look back a few hops and start to be able
to deduce how much Bitcoin you have. So in that case, what I tell people is, you know,
if you're worried about the sort of sender level of privacy, then make your payments
through a coin join. If you need to send money, coin join it and then send it. But the people
who are just like constantly tumbling their coins, unless you're actually like a maker
on join market and you're getting paid to do that, I think you're probably wasting a
lot of money in fees. Otherwise, what are you trying to protect against? If you're really
trying to protect against, you know, nation state level actors, then why are they after
you? You probably have bigger problems that you need to be worrying about. But I guess
for the short version is like coin join is a really tricky thing. And especially like
some of the stuff that's been having happening with Wasabi lately. It's making that environment
a lot more chaotic. And the short version is I do not coin join particularly often myself
unless there's a specific use case where I think I need to be making a payment and I
need that level of privacy. Yeah, I would agree that it's I mean, Bitcoin
just isn't like a native privacy tool really. And I think, especially now that there's really
sophisticated forensics and surveillance tools layered on top of it. And I don't know if
either you guys saw Jonathan Levin from G analysis sparring with everyone's favorite senator
from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren. Amazing. But I mean, as I was watching that, and for
anyone who hasn't listened to it, or hasn't seen it's well worth watching. I had two thoughts.
One was Elizabeth Warren, someone has prepped her somewhat, right? She's gotten better.
She has a better understanding, I think flawed, right? But still she's got a better understanding
of the space. And Jonathan Levin is, you know, he's actually like a defender of the space.
And I think that's great. But I'm also at the same time, very concerned about the extent
to which the surveillance tools have gotten really sophisticated. And so, you know, there
is some just like native lack of privacy in Bitcoin. And then there's this augmented lack
of privacy that comes from these tools. And I know that, you know, there's a counter argument
that says, well, everyone, the regulators are more comfortable because the tools exist.
But I guess I'd be curious, Jameson, where do you fall in the in the our blockchain forensics
tools, you know, advancement for the space? Are they hindrance to some of the principles
or both?
I mean, I think they're going to exist because there's a market for them. And the customers
have a lot of money because they're generally nation states. And it's just it's a it's a
fact of life that we'll have to deal with. I mean, these are adversarial networks who
have to assume that people are going to be surveilling them and trying to use them to
track anyone for any reason. So funny story, though, I actually met Jonathan Levin and
I think 2014 or 2015. And and we we were actually suffice to say, he was working on a project
at the time called Coinlytics, which was somewhat similar to what eventually became Chainalysis.
But I was in discussions with like joining that that company with him. And, you know,
it would not have been a far-fetched future, I think, where I could have been like one
of the early engineers at Chainalysis. And, you know, thankfully, it didn't go that way.
But it's just a small world.
It's amazing to see the the current state of legislation. And, you know, even even just
a couple of years ago, even the time period that we were talking about with, you know,
the block size wars and just the complete lack of understanding from from Congress,
which I think is still very much exists. But they're really just they're really trying
to fit that square peg into the round hole. And they're just going to keep trying. So
anyway, I want to be respectful of your time, Jameson. We can't go down that rabbit hole
too much. But it's always interesting to chat with you, chat about privacy. Thanks a lot
for joining. You know, as we wrap it, any final thoughts? And Alec mentioned it, lop.net.
Absolutely. That's a link our listeners should go to. But yeah, any any final thoughts? Where
else can our listeners find your work?
You can follow me on Twitter at LOPP and check out the security offerings that my company
has at keys.casa. That's C-A-S-A. And usually my my final takeaway on any privacy or security
stuff is that it can feel very overwhelming, especially if you're listening to experts
talk about various rabbit holes and complexities that they've endured. But you should not let
that deter you from at least starting to scratch the surface. You can spend a few hours improving
your security and privacy. It doesn't have to be the insane extreme levels that we have
gone to. And any improvement that you can make any amount of resources you can put into
it is just going to make your posture better than 99% of the rest of the people in the
world. And if you're a harder target than most other people, then it's a lot less likely
that you're going to end up suffering and being attacked in the first place.
Excellent. Jameson, thanks a lot for your time. Always appreciate it and all the best.
Thanks. Bye.
Cheers, Matt. Thank you.

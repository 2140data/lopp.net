But yeah, my name is Zach.
I work on the sales team here at CASA.
We're going to be co-hosts in this space.
With everybody's favorite, Jameson.
It looks like he's up here.
Got in now.
Yeah, and today's conversation will be real open and free-flowing.
So if you have questions, the topics will be generally guided towards Bitcoin for families,
what that means, creating a legacy plan, especially on the heels of our new shared accounts feature.
Perfect. Jameson, can you hear us?
Yeah, can you hear me?
Yep.
OK, great.
You want to introduce yourself?
Hi, I'm Jameson.
I'm the founder and CTO of CASA, and I've been doing Bitcoin stuff for nearly a decade.
And as we've been through multiple cycles here and people have had the opportunity to build,
in some cases, generational wealth problems and addressing the past few years of trying to help
people navigate this new environment, straddle both the legacy financial planning and this new era
in which we have even greater possibilities and things that we can do
if we're actually directly controlling our own finances.
Awesome, thank you.
And yeah, as mentioned, the format for today's space is going to be fairly loose.
It's going to be pretty much an open Q&A.
We've got some questions already.
But if you have a question, feel free to request and we'll bring in stage and let you ask it to these guys.
And so I wanted to start with just an overall overview of why is inheritance planning and legacy
planning so important for Bitcoin in particular?
Sure, I'll go first.
Well, you know, I think this concept of low time preference and thinking ahead is a sort of product
of the decentralized nature and resiliency of Bitcoin mixed with the finite supply.
So it gives you some sort of predictability with which you can plan your future around.
And I think Sam Callahan at Twitter or at Swann or Eric Gates would probably explain it better.
But as far as I understand, the monetary systems reset every 80, 100 years.
And so there's never even been like an asset class other than maybe gold that you could
plan this far ahead for and truly actually with confidence think that it'll be similar
to how it operates today.
So for me, that's why legacy planning with Bitcoin is both unique and extremely important.
What do you think, Jameson?
Yeah, so this is a very different model, right?
With most traditional financial products, the asset itself or the sort of registration
or control point of that asset is held by a trusted third party, some financial service
or authority somewhere.
And so while inheritance planning is still important, if you only have more traditional
assets, it's critically important if you have crypto assets, if you are taking custody
of your own assets, holding those private keys, because there is no court system, there
is no probate, there is no authority that can decree if you get hit by a truck, that
yes, your assets should all transfer ownership to parties X, Y, and Z.
Much like with how Bitcoin security is something that you need to be upfront about and put
in the time and effort to research, understand, and build your security posture, this all
has to be front loaded, because if a catastrophe occurs, there is no going back.
There is no one that can create the path of inheritance or recovery that you want if it
hasn't already been set up ahead of time.
Awesome.
And what are the primary ways that somebody can go about setting up a legacy plan from
say, a beginner all the way to a whale?
Well, the easiest way is to make sure that your private keys are, if not accessible by
your family, the knowledge of how to access them is readily available.
But there are obviously weaknesses in that, being that someone who you might not intend
and that with which you cannot enforce, may not be able to access your private keys, and
not enforce, may try to access it other than your family.
And so that, you know, I think that's a big part of where this key sharing and multi-key
structure of custodial Bitcoin, when you're holding it yourself, really comes into play.
Turn it over to Jameson.
Yeah, I think that some of the centralized custodians have added the ability for you
to designate beneficiaries in your account.
So, you know, they're basically going down the same type of traditional system that you
would see in other financial providers.
But if you're in the realm of self-custody, which obviously we're very biased about and
believe that everyone should put in the time and effort to get to that point.
Well, you need to be a lot more careful in the sense that you have some trade-offs.
And particularly, the problem is that you obviously you want to be in a setup situation
where only you can access your funds.
You know, you don't want other random people to be able to come in and access your funds.
But the flip side and what makes this whole discussion so much more complicated is that
we have to all understand that we are human.
And as far as we know, there's basically 100% chance that we're going to die and we don't
know when.
Therefore, you want to have some way that people who you designate as your heirs can
access those keys.
So it's, you know, it's some trade-offs because you're getting into more of a shared
custody situation.
The stuff that we're going to be talking about today is really more about shared custody
with one other trusted party.
We will not be talking as much about the inheritance planning services that CASA has
offered for several years because that is a slightly different model that ensures that
no one has access to your keys until after you have died.
Perfect.
So, yeah, you want to give us a quick overview of shared accounts?
Sure.
I'll take this one.
So a shared account is if you've got, you know, a brokerage account with stocks or
something, it's a co-owned account with typically a spouse, though it doesn't have
to be, and this person is, as far as CASA is concerned, authorized just in the same
way you as a primary owner would be.
So to set one up, it's easy to do.
You would just need to make sure that the account owners both have access to the same
information, so the same shared email address, both using what we would hope would be a
shared password manager to not have to send that unencrypted, as well as shared access
to the PIN codes.
So obviously, you know, if CASA is here to step in and provide a single signature, in
the case of one of the primary account owners passing, they would still need, because of
it as a multi-key wallet, they would need to access the other keys.
So making sure the PIN codes and other sensitive data that the actual individual would be
holding are shared amongst both co-owners.
And this is different from our inheritance plan, as Jameson mentioned, which notably
differs in that those take effect after the event of the primary owner's death, whereas
the shared account is a co-owned account throughout the life of the owners.
And if the primary owner was to pass, the account would be reverted back to an individual
account, and CASA would work with that individual to make sure that they can recover their funds.
Awesome, I just pinned a tweet to the top of this chat to a blog post where we talk
about shared accounts and some of our other options in general.
So Jameson and Zach, so why is CASA unveiling these shared accounts now?
How have things changed?
I mean, it was a need that we saw arise from our own clients.
There was certainly interest in our inheritance program that's a lot more involved, however.
We had clients who wanted something that wasn't quite as complicated and also was more of
a co-managed type of setup.
So people with joint finances, for example, they don't necessarily want to lock out their
spouse from all of the crypto finances.
So this was really a culmination of market demand on our part and wanting to be able
to offer something that was a bit simpler for people to get into.
Awesome, and what type of a Bitcoiner would be at home with a shared account?
Who are these meant for or who could get the most value from them?
Yeah, I see a couple scenarios.
I think the main one is a husband and wife or a couple where they just want to make sure
that if the other partner passes, the corresponding other partner can access their funds.
Usually I find that one spouse is more involved in the management of Bitcoin than the other.
So we don't have as many where it's like both members of the couple are like die-hard Bitcoiners.
But that's the first thing.
I've seen scenarios where a parent and child, let's say you as maybe a savvy 30-something
year old Bitcoiner have told your parents about Bitcoin early, but they know and you
know darn well that you don't want to trust them with the custody or they don't want to
take that risk on themselves.
Maybe they're just now getting to using a smartphone.
So in this case, you could entitle a parent or maybe even a trustee, which can settle
your affairs.
This might even be the cleanest way, depending what type of inheritance plan you have already
set up with your other assets, given that this trustee doesn't own the assets, but especially
if you have multiple sub-accounts within CASA can then help to distribute the assets as
per your will and court documents.
Awesome and if we were going to compare this with the traditional inheritance offering,
what are the similarities and differences between a shared account and a Bitcoin inheritance
plan?
Yeah, so again, the differences are really the biggest difference when it takes effect.
So the inheritance plan would be post-mortem of the primary account owner, whereas the
shared account would be active as soon as you enroll and if you're already a CASA Platinum
or Diamond member, you could log into the webpage and enroll yourself and it just takes
a little bit of documentation and will confirm everything.
One thing that is different as a result of this is how the recovery key, which is the
single key that CASA houses, is managed and protected.
And so in an individual Platinum account or an individual Diamond account, just the primary
account owner would need to be present on the live video call if you need a signature
from CASA, whereas in the shared account, both shared account owners would need to be
present.
They don't necessarily need to be in the same room, but do need to be on the video call
together.
So that is one thing to keep in mind when setting up a shared account and the biggest
differences there.
So active when both parties are alive and both parties must be present during the video
call recovery signing.
Okay.
And are there any restrictions on who shared accounts are available for?
So it's available for United States citizens.
As far as I know, that's the only place we offer today.
Jameson, if you know otherwise, please correct me.
But as far as I know, that's U.S. today.
We obviously have want to expand this, I mean, as CASA, we have lots of customers all over
the world, but there are certain challenges with verifying legal documents and other jurisdictions
that which we don't normally operate, not to mention, you know, fraud and just a total
language barrier.
So we are conquering the inheritance side of the United States where our largest customer
base is and from there, you know, hopefully as we figure out some ways to do this, we
can offer it to, you know, more worldwide, more worldwide.
Okay.
This question came in through DM.
So this person was wondering, so shared accounts are obviously a good fit for, you know, people
that are in a committed relationship or a marriage or family or maybe they're managing
it for, you know, their parents or somebody else.
But say things get rocky between the two of them or maybe this is a couple that gets divorced.
How would a shared account factor into protecting your Bitcoin when there's, I guess, a parting
of ways?
Yeah, I mean, this is not really a novel problem in and of itself as, you know, there are plenty
of traditional financial accounts that are shared and, you know, once you get into a
legal separation and divorce arrangement, my understanding is that you're generally
not supposed to be touching the assets in any of those shared accounts.
You know, they're supposed to get divided up and in a way that all parties agree upon.
So there it is possible, of course, for one person to become malicious and withdraw assets
from from there.
But much like with traditionally shared financial accounts, you know, there's there's going
to be an audit trail, right?
So it's certainly possible in a situation like that for someone to abscond with funds.
But due to the audit trail, like we would know which keys were used to sign transactions.
I'm sure, you know, other forensic data could be presented to a court.
It's not something that you would want to do if you got into a situation like that,
because you'd have a tough time getting away with it.
That actually is a decent segue to our next question.
So another question we had was, do you have to KYC in order to set up a shared account
or Bitcoin inheritance plan?
So it does require a picture of the co-owner's ID.
This isn't something that is, you know, imposed on us by some government or regulatory agency,
but simply CASA's way of making sure that we can verify who passed away and who is the
rightful owner of the account.
So there you can sign up with CASA with an alias and anonymously, but would not be able
to use the shared account feature in that regard.
It looks like Andrew is joining us, our head of client services.
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Oh, you know, just taking shared accounts and Bitcoin inheritance to the streets.
So Andrew, when you've been speaking with clients about shared accounts, what do they
like about it so much?
What is the solving for them?
They really enjoy the fact that they can share their Bitcoin journey with someone that they
trust and someone that they love.
You know, I think sometimes when people go down that Bitcoin rabbit hole, it's like they
do it by themselves.
But now with like a shared account, you know, they're coaching them.
They're teaching them, OK, this is what a hardware wallet is.
This is what a Bitcoin address is.
This is how you do a health check.
And it's a lot more intimate experience for them.
They also like the fact that, you know, it's one of the ways that their loved one can continue
to have access to the Bitcoin if the client passes away.
And so there's like a piece of a sense of peace knowing that they have that.
Yeah, I would say this is a very common sentiment that I've seen where you have the one hardcore
Bitcoin interested person in the family and they've basically been doing everything on
their own and their partner probably has an understanding that this is a very significant
asset and it needs to be dealt with carefully, but they probably have not been very hands
on with it.
And in many cases, you know, I've heard from the non-Bitcoin or partner that they are they're
hesitant, you know, that they're anxious about what would happen because they simply have
no experience getting hands on and using Bitcoin.
And so they're definitely afraid that even if things are quote unquote set up and in
place just the fact that they haven't ever touched any of this stuff, then they don't
have much knowledge about it.
They're afraid that they're going to screw something up.
Yeah, I mean, it really gives the other party involved the opportunity to learn by doing
rather than just, you know, the lecturing that they may be receiving normally.
So and an opportunity to do that with confidence because you've got the client services team
there to assist.
How does a shared account work for say, you know, a married couple where one spouse is
deep down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and their spouse is not as well versed in Bitcoin and
not necessarily as tech savvy.
How would we accommodate that?
Yeah, so the great thing about our shared accounts is that, you know, the more technical
person can kind of coach and guide and bring their shared member along the journey.
But you know, if they don't want to, they can hop on a call with us and we can coach
them.
We can schedule training calls or training sessions with us and we'd be more than happy
to walk them through.
Hey, this is how you do a health check.
Here's how you send Bitcoin out of CASA.
And so it's kind of nice to, you know, if maybe like you don't have the type of relationship
where you can teach your significant other about Bitcoin, offload them to us.
And we'd be we'd love to coach them and teach them how to do that.
Awesome.
And what would be some cases where somebody is better off going with our more advanced
Bitcoin inheritance plan over a shared account?
I'll take this one.
I think it's, you know, if you have a complicated estate, maybe you're worried that you have
multiple children or multiple spouses, multiple ex-spouses, that there would be some sort
of disagreement or malicious activity that could occur.
That is really particularly where you would want to delegate like a trustee or an executor
as maybe the inheritance side.
I think the other other side, I really see this coming into play is if you want the individual
to have their own login, I know it sounds maybe simple, but sometimes people want to
not share logins and maintain their sense of independence.
And so, you know, at the diamond level, you have additional features like you can delegate
key managers and can also delegate multiple beneficiaries.
So this is one thing that we hear where in the shared account, because it's a shared
account between two parties, there are exactly two parties listed.
But one question is like, well, what happens if, you know, spouse, we're both traveling
together and pass?
Well, at the same time, well, in this case, the diamond plan allows for multiple named
recovery custodians.
And so in this case, you would go down the order there.
So the diamond plan has both a shared account owner and the ability to name two recovery
custodians, which would take effect in the event of your passing.
So if you've got a very complicated estate plan, I would say that typically would be
the case.
But I would defer to Andrew, who works with us on a lot more granular level and see what
he has to say.
Yeah, I would say like the biggest event, like you're so right with the complicated
estate planning.
I would say one of the biggest differences for enrolling in our inheritance program versus
our shared accounts is just when they get access to the Bitcoin.
You know, sometimes when you're with your inheritors, you don't really want to give
them full control of your Bitcoin until after you pass away.
If that's your situation, then the inheritance program is perfect for you.
And one of the things I want and also, you know, we send you a an inheritance package.
So and we create some processes and procedures for you to make sure that you check in on
those inheritance package packages for your intended successors.
So that's also a value add for our inheritance program.
But one thing I did want to highlight, though, is that for those who want to enroll in our
inheritance program, it's really, really important, or even with our shared accounts, it's really,
really important that you do your estate planning ahead of time.
You know, when we think about how to transfer our estate after we pass away, it's unfortunate,
but we have to deal with the legal processes.
So I would strongly recommend talking to an estate planner, figuring all that stuff out
first ahead of time, and what CASA can do is we can make sure and help that the intended
successors that has been outlined in your trust or your will gets actual possession
of the Bitcoin when you want it to happen.
And so just to be clear, just because you enroll in our inheritance program doesn't
mean that you are completely that yeah, just because you enroll in our inheritance program
doesn't mean you get a bypass probate, for example, you need to set up a trust first
in order to legally bypass probate, and then you come to us and then we'll help you and
your intended successors get access to the Bitcoin ahead of time.
Hopefully that helps.
Yeah, and I'll add one thing to that Andrew, so and just because they're nominated as a
recovery custodian doesn't mean that that is all they need to do right because it is
a multi key wallet, you as the end user, the only one that controls it, CASA cannot move
funds without the other keys.
And so this is all taken care of and streamlined, as Andrew mentioned in the inheritance package,
but they do have to, you know, it's not like there is some involvement that will be required
later on when the recovery happens.
So this whole process, especially getting ahead of it.
And, and some people that is, you know, a great way for introduction.
But getting ahead of this plan is how you ensure that it works when the time comes.
Awesome, and what is needed to set up a shared account?
Oh, you got the Zach.
I saw you and me at the same time.
So I don't have the list in front of me.
So if I miss anything, Andrew, can you fill in?
So it's a it's the shared email, shared password, shared access to the devices and pin codes.
There will be a recovery photo that you'll have to replace for you both, rather than
just the individual and the ID of each shared account owner.
Am I missing anything?
No, that's pretty much it and an added dynamic to that CASA recovery photo.
You're right that both people will have to be on that photo.
And we will not sign the transaction if only one person is on the video verification call
that we do when you request the CASA key.
And we need both members on the video call.
So that's something important for people to understand as they figure out how to enable
shared accounts.
And one last thing is that, you know, to use the CASA key, it's included in the plan.
There's no percentage fee that we charge if people request the CASA key in our at our
premium level, nor at the gold level.
Yeah, and just to differentiate.
So at the platinum and diamond level, the CASA key is video verified live by our security
team.
And there's a 48 hour hold, even after you successfully pass.
This is sort of a last line of defense in case you're under duress, you're in a sticky
situation and you're forced to make this request, signature request to CASA when you truly don't
want to.
So it's a 48 hour hold, even if you do pass and have both members present.
And this is different than the gold plan, which is our entry level plan, it's only $10
a month.
And what you can do this is security questions.
So it doesn't require the live video call.
And because of that, obviously, it's not quite as secure questions can be socially engineered,
though we make you answer all three questions that you set up correctly.
And there is a seven day difference and delay there.
So you've got plenty of time.
If you suspect something's gone wrong to call us and let us know.
But in either case, even once you pass the questions or the video call, there's that
delay.
Okay, I thought I'd take a second to quickly reset the room.
So everyone, today's session is a is an open ended Q&A.
So at any time, if you have a question, feel free to raise your hand to jump in.
And we'll ask the panel.
So what would be have have our team ever encountered any situations or read any situations where
inheritance planning went awry or maybe someone didn't have an inheritance plan?
What would be like some horror stories?
I think the most well known inheritance planning failure in the crypto space was Matthew Mellon,
a billionaire heir of I think, BNY Mellon, who he was an early investor in Ripple.
And I think he passed away somewhat suddenly in his 50s.
And I think it was estimated that over half a billion dollars worth of Ripple was lost
forever.
Yeah, you know, the disadvantages of not setting up your estate ahead of time is that your
whole estate goes through probate.
And probate isn't the funnest process.
It's actually very, very public.
And so all your assets can get listed for public record, so people will know exactly
how much your estate was.
And so that's kind of like a liability for your successors that they go through probate.
Plus, it's expensive.
A lot of times the government can issue an administrator to make sure that the assets
gets distributed according to the law, to the probate court.
And that can be quite an expensive process.
And a lot of times they charge a percent based fee of your total assets as well.
And not only that, your estates can also get taxed on top of it.
So overall, who knows how much your successors would really get of your total assets if you
kind of push it off towards the end.
And so those aren't the most funnest things for your family members to deal with if you
pass away.
Hey, Brent, did you have a question for the panel?
Hey, guys.
Yeah, I did actually.
And thanks for putting this on.
And then too, it was nice to hear Andrew mention, hey, visit with an estate planning attorney.
I think it's great advice right off the bat.
But maybe I'm reading too much into this.
Someone had mentioned earlier, maybe entitlements driven.
Is there a way to have a shared account where you have an entitlement maybe for a spouse
or a partner?
Maybe like inquiry only access or anything like that.
And then also, I think Andrew cleared this up on the video call portion, need to have
both of those.
There's no additional questions or anything one might need to answer on the Zoom call
layered on top of just confirming maybe with the ID on file, et cetera.
Yeah, so we go through a verification process where we decrypt the photo that you submitted
earlier and you have to hop on a video call.
So that's how we make sure that both members are actually who they say they are for us
to sign that signature.
Now, hopefully that answers your question.
Could you restate your first question?
I didn't quite catch that.
Yeah, no, that's super helpful.
The first part of the question was maybe Zach or somebody had mentioned entitlements.
Maybe I'm just reading too much into the entitlements language.
Is there a way to have entitlements for that other user or that other individual for the
shared account?
Inquiry only or anything like that?
Or is it just kind of more cut and dry?
Brent, when you say entitlements, do you mean like their ability to know what the balance
would be?
Exactly.
And maybe you mentioned that earlier, maybe I'm just latching onto that word.
Maybe entitlements, whether it's inquiry only, to actually move money, et cetera.
So not at the shared account level, because both of them are co-account owners.
And so at that, you both have full access to the account.
However, at the diamond level, there are key manager permissions.
And perhaps that's what you're referencing in which you don't have to give them the ability
to be able to create transactions, in which case it's effectively they can only sign.
And so for that purpose, it's basically a watch.
They can only view the balance.
They can't send any transactions out, only those that are pushed to them.
So there is that at the diamond level, but not at the platinum.
And I just wanted to add to that, even at the shared account level, I actually helped
a couple set up their key management system for a shared account for a 305 recently.
And this is what we did.
They wanted both people to get involved with signing a transaction.
And so what we did was we split up the keys.
One shared member had access to two keys, the mobile key and one hardware wallet.
And the other member had access to two keys.
And so in the cost of multisig, the 305, you need three keys to move Bitcoin out of that
wallet.
What this requires is for two people to cooperate to send Bitcoin out of there.
And we do this not inside the app, but through who owns the keys.
And the last bit here is, you know, oh, what about the cost of key?
Well, that's also gated by the fact that both people have to be on that video verification
call.
And so it's kind of a neat way for us to have two people co-manage a wallet together in
a trustless way.
Yeah, the main, I guess, meta takeaway that I would mention from what Andrew was saying
is that once you get into a multi-key setup, especially with more keys, like in a 305,
you gain a lot more flexibility in the customization of who can access what keys.
So there's a variety of things that we can do to distribute, for example, the mobile
key onto different devices or to distribute the different hardware keys in different ways.
Or in some cases, it even makes sense to make multiple copies of the same hardware keys.
This I think is one of the areas where it really pays off to have a dedicated client
advisor that can talk through your specific needs and help to customize the solution that
will give you exactly what you want.
Stepping back a little bit to what was mentioned earlier, if you do only want to provide read-only
access to someone, a hacky way to do that is to just give them your CASA login.
And doing that will give them access to no keys whatsoever, but they would be able to
see the transactions and balances and whatnot.
Awesome.
Thanks, guys.
Appreciate it.
Love CASA as well.
Thanks again.
Thanks, Brad.
Yeah, thank you for joining us.
So one good question is, what can a client advisor help with?
Are they somebody that's telling you when to buy and sell the dip, or what kinds of questions
can you ask a client advisor?
That's such a good question.
I feel like one good way to describe client advisors is that we're Bitcoin therapists.
When it's a bear, you can call us up, and we'll hop on a call and just keep telling
you to hodl.
But we can be your one-stop resource for anything Bitcoin related, for digital security, for
best practices when it comes to securing your hardware wallets and OpsSec and all that stuff.
We even have a privacy course that we offer to our premium clients that people can take.
And so yeah, think of us as good Bitcoiners who will help you figure out how to take care
of everything that you need.
Yeah, and to add to that, just give some examples.
I've been asked a wide range of questions that have not necessarily anything to do with
CASA, like how to run a node, or what's the difference in Bitcoin address formats, or
how can I spend Bitcoin more privately?
What's a UTXO consolidation?
The list goes on and on and on, but the point is that we're here to support you in addition
to help you secure your Bitcoin on your own without messing it up.
Yeah, and I feel like everyone is in a different stage when it comes to their Bitcoin journey.
Some people are brand new, and maybe they're not super knowledgeable of hardware wallets
or what a UTXO is, and so we can definitely help out with that.
But even for some of the more technical people, we've got guides and we can help coach and
help those people try to understand how multisave works as well.
And so we really try to meet our clients where they're at, and we try to bring value and
services and knowledge whenever is appropriate.
Yeah, and I think, Andrew, it might be worth, just in case the audience is not familiar,
like reiterating exactly how multisig is different.
So a normal Bitcoin wallet, a single key, we'll call it a public key, is generated from
a private key, and then the addresses are generated from that public key, whereas with
a multisig wallet, there are multiple public keys using the creation of this address.
And so one thing I get asked a lot is, is each key different, or are they all the same?
Is it copies?
And the answer is they are all different.
So the way I usually use analogy, imagine you're making a lock and you use the schematic
of key A to create the lock and the keyhole.
Well, in this case, you're creating a lock with keyholes A, B, and C, and this specific
combination is used to secure your Bitcoin.
And because you're the only person or individual, or in this case, maybe you and your partner
or other shared account owner, because you're the only ones that have the majority of the
keys, in this case, you're the only person that can open the lock or access the Bitcoin.
However, the benefit is, by Casa holding just one key, if you lose one of these keys,
which can happen, we're there to help you recover funds.
So lost keys don't equal lost Bitcoin.
So particularly if you're already set in your mind that you're going to be holding Bitcoin
for the long term, and already set in your mind that this is something that you want
to hold and not leave with a custodian, and maybe you recognize that maybe storing a large
portion of your wealth is not practical to do on just a little USB flash drive, at least
not one by itself, then this is really where Casa can help and where a multi-key, a multi-signature
wallet really can add a lot of value to your security model.
Speaking of security models, so this question just came in, and it might be for the legendary
cypherpunk himself.
So Jameson, how does OPSEC change when you have a family versus when you're just an individual
Bitcoiner?
What's different about and what do you need to consider?
Yeah, it's hard.
I've actually had this question a few times, and there's really, there's not a lot of resources
out there that talk about privacy and operational security for a whole family.
It especially gets difficult when children come into play because there are a lot of
aspects of governments that require you to do various registrations around your children
and associate yourself with them and your physical address and so on and so forth.
So yeah, I unfortunately do not have any great resources to point people to other than to
say that it becomes more difficult for every person that you're adding into the mix that
is multiplying all of the privacy issues that you have to think about and deal with.
So I think the most common thing is that people generally relax a bit or give up a bit because
in most cases, you're probably not going to be able to get the other members of your family
to follow the same level of strict procedures that you yourself may be willing to do.
So I think there are some concessions that end up having to be made there.
There are a few people who value privacy extremely highly to the point that they're willing to
make major lifestyle changes.
But this is definitely something I'm going to keep my eye out for, and it may in fact
be an interesting new niche for privacy conscious people to get into and start researching and
publishing stuff about.
But to date, I haven't really seen a whole lot of material that focuses on that aspect.
Gotcha.
Thank you.
And in the space, I've pinned a tweet that has a landing page with some more information
about shared accounts for those who are interested.
But Zach, Andrew, and James, what would you say are the primary takeaways as we come to
a close of this Twitter space?
I would say there are unique considerations with self-custody that need to be taken into
account beforehand.
Because of that, you have an opportunity to create a security model that works for you
and is customized for you.
It's not like you're putting a box and it's like, here, just leave it at Charles Schwab
or leave it at Coinbase.
We'll figure it out later.
Bitcoin strengths are oftentimes some of the weak parts in that case too, right?
That's why the inheritance problem is both a challenge, but that same challenge is what
gives it its censorship resistance and its resiliency against government attack.
So there are roadblocks, but none that can't be overcome.
And so like all things, self-custody, it's a journey, and we're here to help.
So I think we're constantly trying to make this goal of digital sovereignty for all easier,
more accessible.
And so yeah, I think just like solving the problem of inheritance for couples and families
that want to make sure that their affairs are taken care of, I think that's a great
step towards it.
I would just want to say that by no means am I saying that everyone needs to set up
an inheritance program.
There are in fact plenty of legitimate reasons why you might not want to.
And I'm perfectly fine if people want to donate all of their Bitcoin to the greater community
by losing it forever, permanently.
There's certainly a number of people I've talked to who feel very strongly that that's
the way things should be.
Maybe you don't believe that your heirs should be given your wealth that you earned.
Maybe they should have to earn it themselves.
But if you are not of that mindset, this is certainly a complicated problem that needs
some time and effort put into it upfront.
You've put in a lot of research and development on our end over the past few years from talking
to our clients and thinking through various scenarios.
And we're more than happy to help you out if that is something that you do want to be
able to leave for your heirs.
Yeah, I'll provide a different perspective.
You should definitely take seriously your state planning, get started on it now.
Make sure that you figure out not only the legal side of it about how to successfully
transfer your asset privately and in the most tax efficient way to your loved ones, but
also that they can actually take possession of their Bitcoin.
And one of the beautiful things about Bitcoin and CASA is that it's all self custody.
So that means we try to create technologies, create products and features that continues
to help people remain a sovereign individual.
And the inheritance program and the shared accounts programs are both great examples,
I think, of that as well.
And so, yeah, take care of your state ahead of time, plan ahead so that your successors
don't have to deal with the terrible aftermath of probate.
So to summarize both James and Andrew's perspectives, the value that your Bitcoin have are going
to be donated to someone.
So whether it's your heirs or the rest of the world, the world's heirs is up to you.
So if you want it to be yours, the time to plan is beforehand.
Awesome.
Thank you, everyone.
And thank you to all those who joined to listen.
This has been a great discussion.
And if you're interested in getting started with a shared account, you could find us at
keys.casa.
And then we're also on here on at CASA HODL.
And feel free to hit up either Zach Jamieson or Andrew, and we'll get you squared away
and give you a legacy plan for the future.
Thank you very much, everyone.
Take care.

We'll see you after the show.
Jameson Lopp, welcome back to Crypto 101, sir.
Good to be here.
How have you been doing?
It's been about eight months since we spoke last.
What have you been up to?
Oh, you know, just completely changing my life
and burning my old life
and starting all over again from scratch.
Well, that's a big statement.
What does that mean?
What is changing your whole life
and burning your old life?
Besides, I saw that you deleted your Facebook.
What's been going on?
I moved out of the house that I built 10 years ago
and had been living in
and basically recreated all of my accounts
and property ownership
and everything that was tied to my identity,
recreated it through legal entities
that protect my privacy
and have basically rethought every aspect of my life
from a privacy standpoint
in order to try to prevent any future physical attacks
against me.
This all stems from that one incident back over a year ago?
Yeah, it was basically the swatting incident
in October of 2017
that resulted in my whole neighborhood getting locked down
and bringing unwanted attention to myself.
That's insane.
Can you tell us a little bit about that story
or what happened?
I know that if people follow you on Twitter,
they definitely know this story,
but if they don't, they have to hear the story.
Yeah, if you want all of the details,
I have a post on my Medium blog
that is basically a minute-by-minute recounting of that day
because it was fairly interesting.
But suffice to say that I was going
about my normal Monday routine
and was at the gym and came back home
and couldn't get into my own neighborhood
because the police had blockaded it.
And it took a few minutes,
but eventually we figured out
that they were actually there to go to my house
because they thought that I had killed a bunch of people
and was holding other people hostage.
So thankfully it all ended
without them storming into my house or anything
since I was the one who actually ended up approaching
the police.
And we then figured out pretty quickly
that it was some anonymous person
who had called my local police department
after routing their phone call
through some throwaway services
to prevent them from being tracked.
And they were just trying to get a response
from the police in order to scare me
and then extort me and try to get me
to give them a bunch of money
so that they would not continue harassing me.
Do you think that this was like a Twitter follower
or somebody that's like a Bitcoin minimalist
or like somebody that debates with you?
Who do you think it was?
They did not give any specifics for their motivation
other than to say that they were trying
to get money out of me,
but they didn't try that hard to extort me.
I think part of it was they may have just been upset
with something that I said
or they were jealous about something
and trying to feel better about themselves
by screwing with me.
And there were a lot of other things
that they could have done after that.
And in fact, after it happened,
I had a number of other people in the space
privately reach out to me and tell me
that they had been swatted
or had all kinds of types of extortion
and pranking basically happening to them.
And so I learned about all of these other things
that well-known people have to deal with in this space.
Basically, as soon as an attacker
can like find your personal information,
they can start screwing with a lot of different things,
even stuff like getting your power turned off to your house,
screwing with your utility bills,
even trying to like forge the deed to your house
and sell it while you're still in it,
all kinds of crazy stuff
simply due to the lack of security
around most of the services
that we're used to using in our day-to-day lives.
Man, I'm sorry that happened to you.
It's scary.
I'm really curious about the steps that you took
to basically rebuild your life, an anonymous life.
This is Cybersecurity Month of October.
We just had two podcasts just about security.
And I know this isn't in our outline
or what we're supposed to talk about today,
but would you mind just going through a couple steps
if somebody wanted to have an anonymous life,
what they could do?
Yeah, and I also have a extremely long blog post
that I published about a month ago on Medium
where I talk about everything that I've learned
over the past year and everything that I've instituted.
And the tricky thing is that I can give advice
that applies to like your digital life,
securing your digital accounts
and keeping your digital activities more private.
But when we then start talking about
your physical operational security and privacy,
unfortunately in those cases,
it often comes down to what jurisdiction you live in
because different legal avenues will be available to you.
So most of the stuff that I ended up writing about
was of course relevant to the United States
and living as a citizen there
and the various options that we have
with regard to setting up LLCs and trusts
and other legal entities that you can use
to basically shield your identity
and create these legal firewalls and legal proxies
that make it hard for the average person
to penetrate through to find that
your identity is the one behind them.
Unfortunately, if you want to have extreme privacy
like what I've done,
you generally have to end up expending a lot of resources
both in terms of time and research
and often in legal and banking fees as well
to set up all of these different things
and even figure out what's available to you.
How do you feel, man?
I mean, you built the house 10 years ago.
You just basically took your whole identity
and threw it in the garbage.
I mean, are you okay?
Oh yeah, I mean, I was ready for a change anyways.
And this whole thing has been kind of an adventure.
You know, I've even gone so far as to stress test it
and hire private investigators to try to find me.
And so far so good,
though one of the things that I talk about in my post
is that when we're talking about privacy and security,
there's no such thing as perfect privacy
or perfect security.
It's always a question of how difficult
are you gonna make it?
What level of resources will be required
in order for an attacker to pierce through
whatever protections you've set up?
And so at the end of the day,
nothing I've done would protect me from an agent of a state
that has nation level resources behind them.
But that's not really what I'm so worried about.
I'm mainly worried about these random folks
who they know their way around the dark net
and they can hack their way in and out of systems
and they can get access to various leaked databases.
And so really from that standpoint,
all I'm trying to do is make sure that my residents
and that address is never put into any database
along with my real name
because I'm just operating under the assumption
that every database that this information ever goes into
is eventually gonna get leaked
regardless of what security precautions
that organization takes
to try to prevent that from happening.
And a link to your website,
your medium will all be in the description.
You guys have to,
if you don't follow Jameson Lopp,
please follow him on Twitter and read his post.
Very, very good quality material there.
But the icing on the cake to your transition
to being anonymous was almost justified
in your amusement park trip, wasn't it, the other day
where you bought a ticket to an amusement park
with an anonymous credit card
and they didn't allow you in?
What happened there?
Yeah, and so this has been one of the other
kind of adventurous aspects of taking my life down this path
is that I've run into various roadblocks
where you basically find that usually corporate bureaucracy
and the sort of surveillance machine
that's running behind a lot of corporations
ends up kind of choking
when you try to approach it from a privacy standpoint.
And so basically I bought tickets
to an amusement park recently
and went online,
made the purchase with a throwaway debit card
and basically put in a disposable email address
and billing address information
when I actually purchased the ticket.
And then I noticed that they never
actually emailed me the ticket.
I had the order confirmation,
but unlike the other people
that were attending the park with me,
I did not receive the email with the actual ticket.
So we get to the park and I go up to the check-in counter
and give them my confirmation number
and the lady looks at it and then she's like,
I have to call a manager.
So then the manager comes over
and they start grilling me.
They're like, what's your address?
What's your phone number?
What's your email address?
I'm like, well, these are the ones that I used
when I bought the ticket.
And they're like, well, why didn't you
put your real name on there and your real information?
And I'm like, well, I value my privacy.
And this was all kind of ridiculous
because I was standing there
and I was showing them my passport
and I was giving them my fingerprint.
They do biometric identification
at a lot of theme parks now,
at least in the United States.
And so even after going through all of that,
they said, it's our corporate policy
that we have to cancel your ticket and refund you.
And I was like, okay, so can I buy a new one?
And they're like, oh yes, sure.
So I take out my wallet and I give them a bunch of cash
and then they just give me a new ticket.
So this whole experience was just ridiculous.
At the end of the day,
I still managed to retain about as much of my privacy
as I could have by just switching to cash payment.
But their bureaucracy dictated that
because their surveillance machine
could not positively identify me
and tie together all those bits of information
that they deemed me too suspicious to sell the ticket to.
That's logically just ridiculous.
The mouse no likey, I guess, huh?
Yeah, I mean, the only way I can figure,
this is at least probably partially
for other security purposes.
At least in America, a lot of these places
that allow large numbers of people into
now have to worry about things like bombings
and mass shootings and what have you.
But they have huge levels of security
when you try to get into them.
You have to go through basically airport level security
to get into any of these entertainment parks these days.
Yeah, security in the parks is a big deal
because in the United States,
there is a problem with mass shootings
or bomb threats and terrorism.
And sadly, it's a lot of homegrown terrorism.
Do you think that these precautions are needed?
I mean, do you feel that all of these things
that you had to go through with the burner card,
the cash or what have you,
even though the cash just makes no logical sense,
do you think that the park should have
these safety precautions in place?
Well, morally, I believe that the owner of that park
has the right to dictate whatever terms they wish
upon the people who enter.
So I don't have any particular right to complain
that I should be able to bring my various means
of self-defense into that park.
It's kind of part of the contract that I'm agreeing to
when I enter onto their land
and agree to pay for the entertainment services
that they're providing.
But outside of that,
I think that we would be a more robust society
if people were generally more capable
of defending themselves.
Now, this gets into a really hairy situation
and questions that people debate about a lot of,
well, is an armed society a more polite society
or a more robust society?
Or is it just a society
where people are more likely to kill each other
because they are gonna pull out a weapon
and use it without first resorting to other means
of resolving a dispute?
But if I'm following the general gist
of how you create anti-fragile networks,
then I would think that when you have a bunch of people
or nodes or participants in a network or what have you
that are basically coexisting with one another,
but they can't defend each other,
then it creates basically a honeypot for an attacker
to go in and cause a lot of damage.
And so that's why a lot of these attackers
end up going to places that a large crowd of people
who are known to have been disarmed
and are not going to pose a threat to the attacker
because they know they're gonna be able
to basically rack up their hit count
before they have to worry about someone
who can actually defend themselves coming along
and shooting back or what have you.
So there is no perfect answer.
Even if there was a situation
where a certain number of people in a crowd were armed
and some attacker came along,
then there's no guarantee that there would not be
basically friendly fire, of course,
or casualties between two innocent people
due to the fog of war or the chaos of battle
or whatever you wanna call it.
But I do think that at least from my own experience
and having trained with the Krav Maga School
and actually running a number of these scenarios
where I was playing both attacker and innocent victim
in large mass crowd situations,
we found that there's no way
that you can actually prevent an attacker from causing harm.
But the sooner and faster
there is some sort of violent response to an attacker
and it doesn't even have to be with weapons,
but any type of response
that the attacker has to stop going on the offensive
and has to switch to being on the defensive
and that that in and of itself
drastically reduces the loss of life.
Without going into all of the details of what I've done,
I think that any sort of ability to mount
even the slightest defense against such an attacker
causes them to have to slow down
and ultimately reduces the total number of victims.
Going back to what you said just at the beginning,
you said that a park owner has the right
to dictate the rules of his park
or his business or what have you.
In Ohio, and I don't know if in Virginia,
smoking is illegal indoors,
in bars and restaurants and what have you.
Do you think that's an infringement
of their rights as a business owner
for the government to come in and say,
people can't smoke in your establishment?
Absolutely, yeah.
I mean, if you own a particular piece of land
and establishment,
then you should be able to dictate
the terms of what people are doing in there.
Now, I do understand taking this to the logical extreme
and something that ends up becoming very controversial
and pissing people off is that on a similar vein,
I believe that it is the right of a business person
to refuse service to someone.
And by that, I mean arbitrarily.
And that means that yes, it should be possible
or should be legal at least for someone
to be a bigot or a racist or sexist or what have you.
Now, that I think is unconscionable.
I don't think anyone should do that.
And I don't think it makes logical sense to do that.
Why would you pass up on profits and revenue from someone
just because of the color of their skin
or their genitals or whatever?
I would hope that in an ideal society
that that would be so illogical
that very few people would do it.
Or also that as the world becomes more interconnected
and reputation is more easily spread and tarnished
and what have you, that if someone decided
that they wanted to have these type of business practices
that make most people's stomachs turn,
that that would result in more people shunning them
and not doing business with them.
But of course, this is all very gray area,
murky type stuff, which is why when we talk about
what is the ideal world, it's all subjective.
There is no ideal world from any one perspective,
but rather most of the way that I'm building up these ideas
is upon a moral foundation of the non-aggression principle
in that no one should be able to use violence
or the threat of violence to force someone
down a certain path or make certain decisions
or do certain things.
Talking about the ideal society,
one of the political philosophies that you relate with
is anarcho-capitalism.
And anarcho-capitalism as defined by Alex Lalecker,
I'm sorry if I'm getting his name wrong,
on a blog post that I saw the other day is as follows.
Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy
that promotes the removal of a centralized state
in favor of individual ownership,
private property, and free markets.
Anarcho-capitalists believe that the absence
of statute society has the tendency to self-regulate
through the discipline of the free market.
Anarcho-capitalists also believe that
instead of having centrally governed courts
and law enforcement agencies paid through taxation,
private companies chosen by the consumer
could fulfill these roles by competing on open markets.
Do you agree with that definition?
In general, yes.
Then what you end up talking about
is how ideal of a society would this be?
You then end up in many cases arguing with people
about equality and whether that means equality of outcome
or equality of really beginning of your interactions
with other people.
And I think one of the things
that I generally try to impress upon people
is that you read through definitions like this
or just lofty wording of ideal outcomes.
And I try to impress upon people
that I don't think that there is any guarantee
or even that a lot of people
who push the philosophy of anarcho-capitalism
believe that it is going to create a utopia by any means.
I don't think that any type of philosophy
or governance mechanism or lack of governance mechanism
can ever fulfill all of the needs and wants and desires
that everyone has and basically solve every problem
that humanity has.
Rather, like I said, this is more of a moral system
where we're trying to build a society
that is not based upon fear and violence.
And it's definitely debatable and up in the air
as to whether or not that's even possible.
But as I think we'll talk about shortly,
we do believe that some of the technologies
that are being developed could help us get there.
And that is the segue we needed right there.
All societies are not gonna be perfect.
We can all agree with that.
I mean, I'm a Trekkie.
I've watched Star Trek growing up, man.
And that's the word I wanna live in.
I guess that I'm really fascinated by anarcho-capitalism
because it's the total opposite, I think, of Star Trek.
Yeah, though there definitely could be similarities.
So really the more interesting thing about Star Trek,
I think, is that it's based upon them living
in a post-scarcity society.
And so what do you do when you live in a world
where technological advancement has gone so far
that everyone's basic needs can be met
and then they can be free to fulfill their lives
by doing absolutely anything or nothing at all?
Interesting, interesting.
Anyway, going into the blockchain version,
because I know this is a crypto show.
So talking about an anarcho-capitalist society
or any society, in this blog,
Alex said that trust is a key factor
in making an anarcho-capitalist society a reality.
Can you explain how this could work
and why blockchain would be important
maybe in just building any kind of better society
in the future?
Yeah, you could call it trust.
I would call it reputation.
So if you look at the way that society has progressed
really over the past few thousand years,
it's fairly logical how it's happened
where we have created these hierarchies
and the hierarchies are basically a command
and control structure.
And what that does is that allows more efficient
means of basically controlling how large,
macro aspects of society work
and then having lower and lower levels
through these hierarchies
that do more and more specific things.
And that is specifically talking about allowing
for a specialization of skills,
which if you specialize in one very, very narrow skill set,
then you become exceedingly good
and exceedingly efficient at it.
And so if everyone is specializing in very narrow things,
then as a society, as a whole,
we can evolve and become more efficient
and basically end up passing off
a lot of our day-to-day needs to specialists
who are taking care of various aspects of our lives,
whether that is like the production of food
or the storage of our valuable assets
or the maintenance of our homes and our vehicles or whatever.
And so we don't have to worry
about a huge swath of our lives these days
because we can pass it off to a specialist
who can take care of it at a greatly reduced cost,
which can then allow us to spend more time
focusing on our own specialty
and increasing our production
and as a result, getting more money as a result of that
and continuing this sort of positive feedback loop.
But the result of all of this specialization
and these hierarchical command and control systems
is that we've created a society that's a lot more fragile,
it has a lot more systemic risk in it
so that when certain powerful aspects
or organizations within the society
start to do things that are harmful
for most of the society
because the incentives are there for them
to basically be greedy and do stuff for themselves,
that results in these big booms and busts
in various sectors like we saw
in finance and housing and whatnot.
And so if we're able to replace a lot of that
with a more distributed system
where we can instead of just sort of implicitly trusting
in these various powerful entities
because they're the ones that have existed,
they're the ones that have come into power,
but rather trust in various entities and organizations
because they have gained and maintained that trust
and the rest of our peers agree that they are trustworthy,
then hopefully we can create a society
that is more robust and can allow greater competition
so that if someone or some entity
starts basically hurting their own reputation,
then it's easier for a competitor to come in
and replace them.
But this is all very like vague,
hand wavy, meta level thinking.
If you wanna talk more specifically about doing this,
then that's why I think like Bitcoin
is something that's a lot easier to get your head around
where we are trying to replace one very specific
piece of functionality within society,
which is money and the financial system.
And this, in my opinion, it seems to be the place
that a lot of us can focus our efforts on right now
because I think that if we can get this right
and if we can prove that this particular part of society
can in fact be replaced in a way
that is more fair and more open,
then perhaps, just perhaps we can use that as a model
to then replace other parts of society piece by piece.
And I don't think that there's ever gonna be
like one single point in history
where all of a sudden we flip a switch
and this all becomes reality.
But rather, I do think it's gonna be a very long process
that can take decades, if not generations,
to slowly replace a lot of the pieces of society
that are currently run by highly trusted
and highly powerful governments and organizations
that are very difficult to displace.
And I think that's a great way to do it.
So, I think that's a great way to do it.

Now back to our show.
This is definitely gonna be gradual
and replacing that one piece of functionality as you said,
like Bitcoin or trust or reputation is a huge step
in my opinion.
It's going to, it's changing,
already changing the way we people think
about how society can be constructed.
And I'm kind of curious about what society looks like to you
after 10 years or a generation or multiple generations,
if everything is laid out,
and I know this is a little bit Star Trek thinking,
talking about a sci-fi in the future,
but what would it look like to you?
For me, I have the model of Star Trek.
I have the post-scarcity society that as you said,
I have flying through space,
getting my food from a replicator,
healthcare is free, everything's free.
But what would your society look like
if everything goes according to plan,
according to Jameson Lopp's plan?
So you know, the question of like, will everything be free?
That gets into almost like a basic income or, you know.
I guess I don't wanna say would everything be free.
That's not my question.
My question is, what would Jameson Lopp think?
Would you still have to compete for the best healthcare?
Would you still have to compete for the best job?
Is competition among yourself
or is it competition against your neighbor?
And are there still, let's just say, poor people?
Is there still poverty?
Is that something that's needed
in the construction of any global society?
Let's just say to encourage people to keep moving forward.
Yeah, I mean, I do think that there will always be
quote unquote poor people and quote unquote rich people.
But if you think about it,
poor and rich is actually a relative term.
And if you look at, you know,
the definition of poor and rich people over the long term,
over, you know, many generations and centuries,
then a quote unquote poor person today,
at least in a first world country,
is far better off than the richest aristocracy was,
you know, a few hundred years ago.
And that is mainly due to technology
and, you know, the effects of capitalism and competition.
And so I do believe that it is important
that we continue to have these elements of competition
to incentivize people to continue trying
to better themselves.
Now, how will that change?
I'm very hopeful that with the continual evolution
of robotics and artificial intelligence and all of that,
that, you know, the way that people compete changes.
I certainly believe that any so-called
blue collar jobs of today,
any like manual labor type jobs,
are not befitting of any human.
Like no human should be performing
repetitive physical motion as part of the way
that they sustain themselves.
Like that is, in my opinion,
a complete waste of human resources.
I believe that a human,
our greatest resource is our mind and our creativity.
And that, you know, as a result,
one of these, whether it's a post scarcity society
or just a highly advanced society
where we have managed to continue to automate away
a lot of these menial tasks,
which, you know, of course,
a lot of Luddites are gonna scream, you know,
that those machines are going to, you know,
get rid of a lot of jobs.
I think that that's a good thing.
Now, at least in the longterm, it's a good thing.
We will have to deal with issues in the short term of,
you know, job shock and retraining and what have you,
because I think that the pace of technological innovation
is going to continue to accelerate
at a rate that is not possible for the average human
to basically keep up with
if we can't continue to find ways to keep people engaged.
It very well may be that large portions of the population
end up having to sort of be socialized
because like, you know, we may even lose
like an entire generation or two of people
to the mechanization and, you know,
artificial intelligence gains that happen.
But over the long run, humans do adapt.
And, you know, even within a matter of years,
you know, humans can get completely retrained
to be thinking about and specializing
in completely different fields and industries.
And so once again, there's no utopistic outcome here.
There is always going to be conflict and strife,
but I do believe that even despite a lot of the pain
that is going to be felt at like a global level,
that ultimately we will continue lifting humanity up,
you know, by our own bootstraps as it were,
so that each generation will successfully be
in a better position than the one before it.
That is at least assuming that we manage
to get through the next few hundred years
without completely destroying our planet
and killing each other.
I 100% agree with the repetitive motion in jobs like that.
It's just, it really is not human.
It's funny, my ICO 101 host, Aaron Paul,
just tweeted probably just an hour ago
of how people go into his job.
And he's a general manager of a place
that does repetitive motion.
And people go in there and they say,
hey, do you want to work here?
They're like, yes.
And they say, how many hours a week do you want to work?
And they're like, yeah, we'll work 40, 45.
When really they mean, and this is what he said,
they mean they want to work 25 because, you know,
doing that job is just, it just steals your soul, honestly.
It steals your soul.
But you said ways to get people engaged.
And we're going to switch this over to Bitcoin
and blockchain for a little bit
because we hope I want to keep my listeners engaged
since this is a Bitcoin blockchain cryptocurrency show.
Moving into this future or the society,
trustless or based off a reputation,
what advances or steps are being made right now
in crypto and in technological advancements
to get us to where you see we need to go
and developments of say wallets
and decentralization in the technology?
You know, this is something that I've been focused on
for a number of years and that a lot of other people
are also focused on is it's the technical aspects
of building hardware and software that enables people
to take advantage of the protocols and the systems
that have been developed but that are still so complicated
that the average user is never going to understand
how they work but that's not the goal either
because if you look at the way the internet has progressed,
for example, almost nobody who uses the internet today
knows how it works.
They don't know what's going on under the hood
but rather we've built so many layers of abstraction
on top of this base set of protocols
that a toddler can pick up a phone or a tablet now
and start just poking around and exploring
and figuring things out and entertaining themselves
and educating themselves and, you know,
making basically use of the entire sum of human knowledge
that is now at their fingertips
and this kind of goes back to what I was talking about,
you know, retraining and issues there
with kind of wage gaps and shocks and the labor market
is that one of the reasons that I believe
that it won't be as bad as it could have been
if this had happened in an earlier age
is because we now have this level
of communications networking
where knowledge is practically free, you know,
for the cost of an internet connection,
10, 20, $30 a month, at least in the United States,
hopefully less elsewhere.
I think a number of countries
actually provide internet access for basically free
that now all you are really limited by
is your own curiosity.
Going into the internet a little bit,
you said that the internet is built on layers and layers,
so it's easy enough for even a toddler to use it.
That's interesting
because there's a lot of debates lately about Bitcoin.
A lot of people coming out to say they're anti-Bitcoin,
but internet debates are still happening
with banks, companies, governments about, you know,
multi-topics, if it's net neutrality,
if it's access as a human right, or even censorship.
These debates will never stop.
You wrote in a tweet the other day,
which I thought was a great tweet, by the way,
was Bitcoin is not going to succeed
due to its proponents engaging in successful debates
with skeptics and antagonists.
It will succeed by offering a superior product
to the global market that outcompetes banks
and nation states.
Can you go into a little bit about your ideas
and thoughts about not only the internet debates,
the blockchain and Bitcoin debates that are happening
with a lot of anti-Bitcoin people out there,
and your tweet, and what does that mean?
One thing that I've kind of come to believe over the years
is that it doesn't really matter what the outsiders say.
And by outsiders, I mean like the people
who aren't actually really participating in this ecosystem.
That's because if you don't have skin in the game,
then the rest of the ecosystem
has no incentive to listen to you.
You don't have any power.
I guess the very worst thing that you can do, I guess,
is to cause loss of confidence
and try to get current people who do have skin in the game
to basically throw up their hands and quit.
That is why when people ask me what I believe
like the greatest weakness of Bitcoin is,
or what is the thing that is most likely
to cause it to fail, I generally respond with apathy.
And that's because as long as there are sufficient level
of interest in people who are willing to participate
and to dedicate their time and other resources
into maintaining the system and continuing to evolve it,
then I don't think that there is anything,
technical or otherwise,
that can cause a permanent failure of the system.
So basically, these networks, these systems,
they can potentially fail,
but even if you can find a way to exploit the code,
the software, the network,
and cause it to stop functioning as expected,
for whatever reason,
I think that that's only going to be temporary
because if the machine consensus fails,
then we just fall back to the human consensus,
which means the people who are interested
in keeping the system going come together and say,
okay, we have a problem.
How do we fix it and move forward?
And there are a number of examples of that happening
in Bitcoin and plenty of other networks,
which really it goes to show the anti-fragility
of these networks.
And so if you want to kind of brainstorm about ways
to really kill the network and make it fragile,
then the only way that I can see that happening
is by getting a large number of the participants
to stop participating,
thus making the network more fragile.
So engaging in these debates is important.
You need people to,
because you're going to have these people coming out
that don't have skin in the game.
They're not invested.
They're just sitting there to spoil some bullshit,
to make people doubt what's going on,
doubt Bitcoin, doubt the network,
get out of the network, stop participating.
And then that's the only way,
like you said, it's going to kill Bitcoin.
But so you have to have somebody come back and debate them.
It's not just about the product.
Is that correct or no?
Maybe.
So if literally no one engaged these people
and they have a huge audience,
then they could potentially have enough influence
to stifle the adoption,
basically slow down the number of new entrants
to the network.
But from what I've seen,
generally these folks are coming along
and they're just repeating the same arguments
that we've heard for years and years.
And they're very, very rarely convincing anyone
who has been a participant in the network to give up
because they're not saying anything new at this point.
So I think that a lot of the antagonists at this point
are mainly doing so to try to bolster their own reputation
and create controversy and basically
get more followers on social media.
And that may result in more media appearances
and more money for them tangentially through other means.
But I personally don't have the time
and wherewithal to try to fight these people
because there's a fairly well-accepted mantra out there
that the amount of energy required to refute bullshit
is like an order of magnitude greater
than it is to create it.
And so from that standpoint,
FUD and bullshit is this asymmetric battle
where you could very easily get overwhelmed
and expend all of your resources trying to counter it,
where I believe that the more efficient means
of allocating your resources are actually to building things
because when you're building things,
it doesn't matter how much FUD someone can come up with.
They can't undo what you've done.
They can't destroy what you've built
just by creating lies and fear.
I can't stop giggling over here about that one, by the way.
I never heard that, the order of magnitude.
But just out of curiosity, when somebody walks up to you,
please don't say you just walk away.
But if somebody walks up to you
and say Bitcoin's a Ponzi scheme, how do you answer them?
Usually I go into the definition of a Ponzi scheme,
which is that the money from the new entrance
gets redistributed to the old adopters
and directly profits them.
But in Bitcoin, it acts as any other publicly traded asset,
which means that sure, while new people coming in and buying
is going to increase the exchange rate,
it is by no means guaranteed that their money is going
directly into the pockets of the people who
already have these assets.
You're basically describing how any free market works.
It's easy to see how people could think of it
as a Ponzi scheme, but you have to go through the steps
to make them understand that absolutely every publicly
traded asset behaves in the same way
that Bitcoin behaves from a market valuation standpoint
and that the people who are in the market
and have been in it longer than others,
yes, the value of their holdings is higher,
but the main reason behind that is
because they took more risk in putting their money
into the market when it was a lot lower, a lot smaller,
a lot more volatile, and thus much less of a guarantee
that it was even going to continue
to exist in the long run.
So Ponzi schemes, there are plenty
of those that are being run on top of Bitcoin
or on top of these other networks,
but the underlying asset itself in no way guarantees
to the early holders that they will get more money out
of the system than they originally put in.
And there's absolutely no guarantee of price
whatsoever within the protocol and within the system.
Before we go into general questions,
is there anything that you would like to touch on
or things that we didn't cover that you want to cover?
I mean, we've covered quite a bit, but of course,
the system is so complex that there's always
more to talk about.
There's always more to talk about when it comes to ideology,
technology, just the space in general.
We can be talking for hours, days.
What do you think of the crypto space these days?
Just in general, like the people, the tech,
the advancements, when you open your Twitter,
as you're very active on it, what do you
think of what's happening right now?
Well, I think one of the biggest changes and one of the more
things is that a lot more quote unquote reputable organizations
have come into this space.
Just, I think, a day or two ago, we
had a big announcement from Fidelity,
which is one of the largest custodians of assets
in the world.
I forget how many trillion dollars worth they have.
And while this announcement from them
may be a surprise to a lot of people,
for folks like myself, we've known
that Fidelity has actually been tinkering around
in this space for several years.
They've just been doing it on the down low,
not really being too public about it.
And that is actually a pretty similar reflection
to what is happening with a lot of other well-known
traditional financial giants, that they actually
started playing around with and trying
to understand this technology a year, even two or three years
ago.
But of course, they're a lot more cautious
and have not jumped in head first.
They're just dipping their toes in the water.
And so that's why you hear these people that
are talking about the wave of institutional buyers
or institutional FOMO or whatever.
And I think that that is going to happen eventually,
though there's no guarantee as to when it will happen.
But point being, a lot of the existing establishment
is, in fact, preparing itself to start onboarding and helping
more mainstream adoption to occur within this system.
I'm just looking up the top asset management firms.
And I already got two prices for them.
But it's in the trillions.
I saw the first thing that came up
was $7.2 trillion of assets under their management,
which is insane.
Well, welcome to the crypto space, Fidelity.
We'll see you on crypto Twitter.
Who do you respect in the crypto space?
If you're following somebody on Twitter,
I wonder if this is going to change from eight months ago.
Who do you follow?
Who do you read?
And who do you always engage with?
I most respect the educators and the builders.
So Andrea Santanopoulos has always
been one of the people that I respect the most.
He has also managed to remain fairly neutral and not
piss too many people off, which is quite an accomplishment.
People like Jimmy Song, who are both developers and educators.
And then some more up-and-comers,
like Justin Bowen, for example, who
has his own Bitcoin programming class
that he has started recently.
And I got to meet him as well at Baltic Honey Badger
Conference.
So I'm just interested in anyone who
is helping create infrastructure and who
is helping onboard more people that
spread the viral effect of this system,
because it is still so new and so, I guess,
overwhelming for new entrants to get in and wrap their heads
around, that it's inspirational to see new people come in
and start contributing in absolutely any way possible.
And that doesn't even necessarily mean writing code,
but really figuring out how you can use your existing skill
set to help build out this system and increase adoption
and make it easier for others to understand.
Is there anybody's Twitter that you follow for entertainment
purposes?
Let's see.
McAfee.
Pretty much.
Well, I would say Brian Hoffman has
had a number of entertaining parody videos.
John McAfee can be somewhat entertaining in a very
out-there kind of way.
Outside of the crypto space, I don't follow too many
non-crypto accounts, but I do follow
one that's very interesting, and it's called 60 Second Docs.
And basically, it's really short 60 second documentaries
that are about all kinds of different people
all over the world.
And I've learned a lot from them and actually
seen a lot of really weird and crazy stuff as a result.
Oh, dude, that's cool.
I'm going to check that out.
What projects are you looking at that are
game changers at the moment?
I think eight months ago, you said the multi-sig wallet.
Are you sticking with that one, or you
have something else in mind?
I've been doing non-custodial multi-sig wallet development
for almost four years now.
And I guess since the last time we spoke, I switched jobs.
And I no longer work for BitGo.
Now I work for CASA, but I'm still doing multi-sig wallet
development.
So I do believe that that particular model
is going to be able to provide the best
level of security and usability for people.
I've just pivoted from focusing on enterprise-level wallet
management to high net worth individual wallet management.
So you still think that those are the game changers.
High-level wallet management is going
to change the future of blockchain.
Well, if we want to get to a point
where people can actually be their own banks
and have better than bank-level security in a user-friendly
fashion, where they don't have to spend
the same level of resources as a bank
in order to secure their money, yeah,
that is the thesis of what we're doing at CASA, which
is that over the long run, years, decades, generations,
our thesis is that the management of private keys
is going to become more and more important and integral
to your day-to-day life.
And so that means it's going to be a lot more than just Bitcoin
and access to your financial accounts.
But it will probably be such that you
will be using private keys to manage
many different aspects of your life
and whether that's access to online accounts,
access to physical property that you own.
It can be used as authentication and proof
of ownership mechanisms for quite a few different things,
including your own identity, of course.
So that's kind of the boring answer
to what's going to help increase this adoption of technology
and change the world.
In terms of more cutting-edge stuff, though,
that people are experimenting with,
I'm very interested in the MimbleWimble protocol.
So the GRIN project is an implementation of that.
And that is promising extreme privacy and extreme scalability
for a financial transacting protocol.
Similar type of thing with Lightning Network,
where I think since the last time we've talked,
the Lightning Network really took a step forward
towards actual adoption and basically getting out
in a beta release, where a bunch of developers and tinkerers
have actually started building on top of it.
And we've seen a number of interesting laps
show up, which have been proofs of concepts
that I believe show that it's actually
going to be a lot easier for developers to dip their toes
into this ecosystem by building applications that
work on the second-layer networks that's
going to basically enable a lot more functionality
and better end-user experience for fast
and responsive crypto asset interactions.
If somebody was just coming into the space right now,
and this was the first podcast they listened to,
what would you want them to know?
Well, it can all be very overwhelming.
And there's a pretty high learning curve.
You can easily dedicate your entire life
to doing nothing more than trying to understand
what is actually going on.
I mean, this whole ecosystem has grown to the point
where, as of a year or two ago, I
don't think it's possible for any single person
to actually keep up with all of the developments.
And so it's kind of funny of people coming to me
and considering me like the expert or the guru.
And yet, I get asked a lot of questions about projects
that I've never even heard of.
Or even if I have heard of them, I
haven't even been able to barely look at them,
much less evaluate them rigorously.
And so I don't know everything.
And I don't have time to know everything.
I am generally focused on Bitcoin
and focused on privacy-centric protocols,
basically anything that I think is falling
under the cypherpunk umbrella of trying
to bring about a world in which we're
able to make strong privacy the default for people.
Because that, I believe, is a key ingredient to freedom,
is the ability to selectively disclose what you're
doing to the rest of the world.
I think I was just thinking that I should probably
move that question to the beginning of the podcast.
Yes, overwhelming.
Yeah, well, I would tell any new person
to go check out my Bitcoin resources on lop.net.
I have tried to organize them in a way such that the resources
at the top start out very high-level, simple explanation.
And then the further down you go on the page,
the deeper and deeper you get into the technical guts
of this system, both from the software
technical side of things and from the philosophical side
of things.
Right on.
I will make sure that that's linked in the description.
That's lop.net.
Great site to check out all kinds of blogs, technicals,
tweets, Jameson, all kinds of things.
Check out his site.
Really quick, before we go, Jameson,
and before we ask this last couple of questions,
I want to say thank you very much for the 50 minutes
to an hour of your time.
I appreciate it.
And thank you for coming back on the show, man.
My pleasure.
Doing a lot of these these days, but to be fair,
doing interviews and podcasts is orders of magnitude
easier than getting on a plane and flying across the ocean
for a 30-minute speech at a conference.
That is for damn sure.
You don't have to deal with the jet lag and all that stuff.
You were just in Japan, correct?
Yeah, scaling Bitcoin.
I think that was my fourth scaling Bitcoin.
I've been to all of them except for the very first one.
Right on, right on.
Going into pop culture, anything in TV, books, Netflix
you're watching, listening to, or reading these days?
Well, for entertainment, I usually
stick to the dystopian, cyberpunk, future-esque type
of stuff.
Actually, I would say the thing that best fits that bill
would probably be altered carbon on Netflix.
And of course, I also try to keep
with any of the zombie-related doomsday stuff.
While zombies aren't everyone's cup of tea,
I do believe that if you're into preparing for a zombie
apocalypse, that'll actually prepare you
for quite a few more realistic disaster scenarios that
can happen in the real world.
Any chance you like the TV show, The Expanse?
You know, I've seen that come up in my feed a few times,
but I have not gotten to watch it, so no comment.
Check it out.
I think it's one of the best TV shows made ever.
It's excellent, in my opinion, though.
What are you listening to these days?
What can I add to the Crypto 101 Spotify playlist
from Jameson Lopp?
Most of the time, when I'm listening to stuff,
it's actually podcasts.
But in terms of songs, I've got a few
that I have in my Bitcoin repertoire.
I think that everyone has to listen to Bitcoin Baron
by Whitey Cracker.
That's a classic from 2013.
And I've actually met Bryce a few times.
Whitey Cracker comes to a number of the Bitcoin events.
And more recently, I'm actually a fan of this track called
Plan B that the co-founder of Unocoin, Sonny Ray,
put out under the DJ name of Bitcoin Boy.
It's a nicely done amateur hip hop track.
And then finally, and this may come as a surprise
to a lot of people who know me, I'm
going to have to say the Bitcoin Cash song by Lil Windex
is, in fact, one of my favorite crypto theme songs of all time.
Even though I may not agree with the philosophy behind Bitcoin
Cash, this particular music video
was perfectly done as a rap video.
And it was just so ridiculous that I probably
watched it several dozen times and was highly
entertained by it.
Right on, man, I think those are great selections.
Jameson Lab, thank you again.
And man, good luck with getting your name off the books,
getting your name out of the bureaucracy,
and well, just disappearing.
Yeah, getting it out is the easy thing.
Keeping it out is the hard thing.
So time will tell.
All right, well, good luck with keeping it out.
We'll talk to you again, sir.
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Bye.
Bye.
Thank you very much for listening to this episode of Crypto 101.
Jameson, thank you for coming on the show.
And I hope to talk to you again in the near future.
In the next episode of Crypto 101,
we have an ICO 101 episode with LendingBlock.
And after that, a Crypto 101 episode
with Mr. John McAfee in John McAfee 101.
Before we go today, like always, ApogeeCrypto.com,
A-P-O-G-E-E Crypto.com for your real-time prices,
CryptoNews.com for your news.
And finally, thank you very much to Mr. Jay LaBella
for editing this episode.
We'll see you in next episodes of Crypto 101.
Thank you very much for listening to this episode of Crypto 101.

We Bitcoiners do our best to self-custody our Bitcoin. We use hardware
wallets, we create our own entropy, we store them in metal, we multisig. But how do we
protect our sats from a $5 wrench attack? To talk about that, I sit down today with
Jameson Lopp, co-founder and CTO of Casa, the company that makes it easy to buy and
secure Bitcoin without wondering whether you're doing it right.
With Jameson, we talk about what is this kind of attack, what should we consider to protect
our sats, what are his thoughts on the coil wallets, multisig, locktimes and covenants
to protect them, and also some advices for beginners that want to start in the self-custody
path.
Before jumping into the show, let me have a second for my sponsors. All of them amazing
Bitcoin companies that support privacy and KYC-free sats. Take a look. First, HODL HODL
and LEN, both amazing peer-to-peer site where you can. First, exchange Bitcoin and second,
borrow and lend it. All peer-to-peer enabling KYC-free sats purchases and finance.
Second, Bidrofit, the website that allows Bitcoiners to buy almost anything with sats.
I use it weekly and thanks to them, I can live the Bitcoin economy in Europe.
Third, Brains, the good guys of Bitcoin mining. If you're into mining, Brains is the place
to go. They created the oldest pool, also co-creators of Stratum V2, they have an amazing
firmware for ASIC miners, and a great blog and dashboard to be 100% updated on how is
the hash rate network right now. And last but not least, IVPN, the VPN that I use because
they are privacy freaks as me. They don't ask me for personal data and I can pay it
with Bitcoin. You can have a look at their services following the links in the description
below. With this said, te dejo con el pod.
Good afternoon, Jameson.
Hi, great to be here.
Thanks for joining. You are Jameson Lopp, a cypherpunk, CTO and co-founder of Casa,
the leading provider of Bitcoin self-custody solutions. I'm really excited to have you
here because recently there has been a lot of talk in the Spanish Bitcoin Twitter community
about how to protect yourself from a $5 branch attack. Because yeah, when you fall down the
Bitcoin rabbit hole, you become like a little bit congenious. You learn things like creating
your own entropy with a coin, dice or something like that. You learn using top-notch hardware
wallet, using passphrase, at least 12 characters long with numbers, symbols and so on. And
also you write your seat in metal and yeah, you feel you are really becoming a master
in security. But then it comes this moment that somebody asks you, okay, but how do you
protect yourself from a $5 branch attack? First of all, could you explain what is this
kind of attack and why it's so often commented in Bitcoin communities?
Sure. So this actually goes back to really a meme, which was popularized by the XKCD
comic a number of years ago. And I think everyone who has heard the term wrench attack has probably
seen that comic, but essentially it means coercion. It means someone is using either
threat of violence against you or someone you care about, or they're actually straight
up torturing you, holding you hostage, using some sort of aggravating factor to try to
coerce you into handing over your money or handing over, in this case, the keys to the
kingdom. And this is a type of attack that people generally haven't had to worry about
in recent years because most people's assets are intangible and not directly controlled
by them. If your money is in the bank or on the stock exchange or one of my favorite sayings
that I heard somewhere was that billionaires don't have to worry about getting attacked
because it's very difficult to steal a baseball team. So it's like when your assets are that
type of asset, it's very difficult for you to simply just hand it over to someone. But
now with Bitcoin being a digital bearer asset, it's once again like gold or cash or something
that you can just simply physically hand a large amount of value over to. So we have
kind of come full circle again back to the days when people would hold their money in
gold under the floorboards or whatever. So now you have to worry once again about the
physical security aspects of being your own bank.
So let's say that the main problem is to have access to a lot of funds with just a few clicks,
yes, it's the problem that it's highly liquid, it's highly portable and you can basically
lose it in an instant and then there's no way to recover it, of course. So the ability
to protect yourself against this type of attack means that you actually have to consider yourself
a potential point of failure.
The worst nightmare for anybody, but especially for a Bitcoiner, is a home kidnap. Do you
have some information on how people normally react in relation to Bitcoin holdings when
together with their family, they are home kidnapped? Do they lie or fight or do they
want to give all the Bitcoin away to finish that suffering?
It's a difficult topic to discuss because I think or at least my guess is that the majority
of incidents we don't hear about. When someone ends up having some sort of physical threat
or violence against them, unless it somehow gets leaked out by newspapers or something,
in most cases, I think people are very unwilling to talk about this because they are afraid
that it will make them an even bigger target for future criminals to attack them like this.
So we can only really talk about, of course, the cases we know about. I do have a project
where I try to keep track of all the ones that have been made public and I think we're
somewhere around 80 or 90 different incidents over the past decade.
And just offhand, from what we know, it seems like the vast majority of cases when these
people find themselves being physically threatened, taken hostage, tortured, whatnot, they almost
always comply very quickly. People obviously don't want to be hurt or see other people
they care about hurt. I'm only aware of maybe one or two incidents where people managed
to successfully defend themselves against an attacker. And I think there were maybe
a few other incidents where they didn't really do anything and the attacker gave up quickly
and left. But it seems like most of the incidents, at least that we hear about, the attackers
are successful in getting some, if not all, of the keys that that person was holding.
That's not very optimistic for us holders, I have to say. But I wonder from a security
planner point of view, how do you evaluate when to give them away or when to risk your
life for your sats? It's very hard. And later I want to ask you about different solutions.
But this is something that constantly comes to my head. Okay, if I want to create a strategy,
here we're talking about my life and probably my family security. So it's hard to find
the point that the evaluation, where to put the line, where is the limit in like, no,
my sats are so important or, or, and then I will protect with all kinds of techniques
or I don't know, let's have like a spare wallet that they can get away with.
Right. So there's a number of different questions and trade offs that need to be made here.
I would start off by saying that I don't think that anyone should value their Bitcoin more
than their life or the life of their loved ones. And that, you know, if you are in a
situation where you're being coerced, then you should probably comply. You know, obviously
there, there's a million different variables of what an attacker could be like, or could
be doing. And, you know, maybe it's an attacker who does not seem like they would actually
be willing to go through with the threats. For example, there was an attack in Amsterdam
just a few months ago, where the guy basically told the attackers to stop bothering him and
they ended up leaving without doing anything. Now, you know, that ended very well, but there
have been other attacks where the attackers did use physical violence when there was resistance
put up. But I think there's the, the first question is what are you even capable of giving
the attacker? So my stance is that if you're trying to protect a life-changing amount of
money that you're storing with cryptographic keys, then you shouldn't even have direct
access to it. You know, it should be similar to trying to go to the bank and, and completely
clean out your account of your life savings. It shouldn't be as simple as just pushing
a few buttons. There should be multiple different types of authentication and, you know, physical
movement required and time constraints. You want to make that process onerous. You want
to make it slow. And the reason for that is that you really shouldn't need to have instantaneous
convenient access to your life savings. Generally, if you're going to be moving large amounts
of money around, it's for some major purchase or large trade that you've been planning ahead
of time for quite a while. So that the, the inconvenience around that, it really shouldn't
be a major inconvenience. And the, the security that you can get as a trade-off with that
inconvenience, it's, well, it's, it's hard to even put a price on it because if you put
yourself in a situation where you don't even have access to the money, then it becomes
a kind of a non-issue of like, you know, there's nothing you can do no matter what type of
coercion is being used against you. Now, you know, this, of course, gets us to the next
question of, well, what is the attacker going to do once, once you start explaining to them
that you can't give them anything. And, and this is where it gets really tricky because
what we're really doing now, this is getting out of the realm of talking about technical
security measures and it's getting into the realm of speculative psychology. And we, you
know, you, you have no idea what your attacker's motivation and situation is going to be like.
And, you know, it may be that they get to the point where they eventually believe you
and then either they do nothing and leave, or maybe they hurt you or, or kill you out
of frustration. I, I would hope, but of course this really depends on the number of variables,
but generally a rational human doesn't kill another human if it's, you know, not going
to get them anything, you know, it's all, all that's doing is creating more risk for
them and having law enforcement expend more resources to track them down. And, you know,
with my own experience with different law enforcement cases, you know, the, the amount
of resources that law enforcement will put into tracking down a thief or a robber is
very small in comparison to what they will put into tracking down a murderer.
Maybe that takes me to somewhere else that is, okay, maybe the attacker gets some information
in that attack and he gets to know that you have, let's say 10 Bitcoins, but you cannot
access them right now. That puts you in another position after the attack. Maybe they leave,
but now they have a very important information. They knew maybe you had some Bitcoin, but
they didn't know how much and 10 Bitcoins is good enough for them to, to try it again.
I suppose that there is a before and an after. This podcast is more about how to protect
before there is a first attack, no, but the situation afterwards, I can imagine that you
fall into full psychosis.
Yeah. So, you know, we may have gotten a little bit ahead of ourselves because whenever we're
talking about security, you know, this is a multi-layered setup that you want to have.
Like I think people probably focus on the actual key management and you know, how am
I storing and backing up my keys? And you know, what's the actual authentication process
required for spending the money? But you don't want the technical security measures around
your keys to be the only layer of security. Just like when you're designing any type of
security system, you want there to be multiple layers of barriers in place. And the reason
for this is, is several fold. One, you, you want to have like your, your outermost layer
of security to make you less likely to even ever be attempted to have someone attack you
in the first place. And so a couple of ways to do that. The first one, and what I consider
the most outer layer of security is actually your privacy. So if you have good, strong
privacy, then very few people should even know that you have Bitcoin or a significant
amount of Bitcoin in the first place. The fewer people who even know that you have this
digital bearer asset, the fewer who can even entertain the idea of trying to plan an attack
against you. The next layer of security that I consider is really just your, your day to
day physical and operational security. You know, how do you go about your day? What is
your, your home security system look like? Is it possible for someone to just walk up
to your front door and kick it in? You know, that's a, I would say probably the level of
security that the vast majority of people have, at least in the United States. I know
some other countries tend to have better fortifications around their homes by default. In many cases,
for example, thefts and robberies in the United States are crimes of opportunity where someone's
just walking around and they see a house and they're like, Oh, that looks like it'll be
easy to get into. They walk up to the front door, kick it in and take whatever they can
in the first few minutes. So if you have some additional layers of security, like some sort
of fence or gate or, you know, other things that kind of push out the perimeter of wherever
you're physically residing, that's just one more thing than an attacker has to get through
in order to get to the good stuff. And so what happens is for a crime of opportunity,
if they're looking and surveying a whole bunch of homes, they're going to say, Oh, you know,
this house has a fence or a wall or this house has a dog and the dog may try to bite me.
Whereas that one doesn't appear to have anything. So I'm going to go for the easier looking
target. You want to portray yourself as a hard target just to disincentivize people
from even trying. And then of course, going on further from that, there's the question
of, well, you know, what are you capable of doing and defending yourself or what type
of alarms and other things do you have in place that would alert you if someone was
trying to break in? And if you become aware that someone is trying to attack you, what
are your defense mechanisms? And of course, there's a whole lot of different things that
you can do. And of course, some of them are going to be jurisdiction specific based upon
the laws in your area.
Some more passive systems like how fortified is your home and also some active like sensors
and so on. This is a very interesting because I'm from Spain. I don't live now in Spain.
I live now in the north of Europe and I see a huge difference in Spain. Everything is
more fortified. Privacy is more important and you would never have transparent fence
nor a transparent window that people can see easy. How do you live in your home? And here
in the north is the opposite, probably because of the need of light, of more light. But it's
crazy how transparent is everything. I could study easily the life of my neighbor and learn
their routines. So that's a very interesting point that maybe I should start applying now
that I live in the north.
But you touched on something that this was spoken on Twitter the other day about privacy.
I use a pseudonym. I don't appear in public with my face. So I believe that privacy is
a feature, not a bug. But some people say, yeah, but you know, in security, this is security
through obscurity. And that shouldn't be the case. You should be ready to be full transparent.
And nevertheless, your Bitcoin should stay safe. Is in this situation as bad to plan
a security through obscurity system? Or you think that no, that in some cases is a good
strategy.
So if your only layer of defense is privacy, then I would agree that you could call that
security through obscurity. You know, if, if all you're doing is hiding a bunch of information,
and anyone who finds where and how you've hidden that can can now attack you and get
your money, then that is what I would consider security through obscurity. Obviously, I'm
a big proponent of self custody and setting up distributed key systems that are very difficult
to attack both physically and digitally. But you, you still want to have privacy because
that can reduce the chance that someone even tries to attack you in the first place. So,
you know, it's, it's good to think of this as you want to have a diversity of different
protections in place. And that's how we get strength, strength through diversity in having
different types of security and authentication mechanisms, and, and privacy around as many
different aspects of your life as possible. Because what I think you'll find whenever
I talk about CASA and the way that we think about architecting solutions is that our,
our primary focus is to prevent and eliminate single points of failure. And the way that
you do that is through diversity and you're having redundancy in as many things as possible.
And, and not using the same exact types of security mechanisms multiple times.
Do you think about having this, what I mentioned before, a secondary wallet, let's say if you
have 10 Bitcoins, so you have, you have one Bitcoin there and you just convince them that
that's good enough to live. Like if you think about thieves as an entrepreneur, no, not
the legal one, not maybe not a moral one, but if you think about it, maybe it's good
enough to take a Bitcoin away. So maybe it's a good time for you to leave and let me alone.
What do you think about that?
And so, yeah, whenever you're thinking about your own setup, if you're thinking adversely,
you think like an attacker, then what we're really wanting to try to understand is risk
and reward because any attacker is going to have that same type of mindset of, you know,
what are the risks that I'm taking to try to pull off this attack and what's the potential
reward if I can pull it off. And, and this is where we once again get into this speculative
aspect of it because you don't know how sophisticated your attacker is going to be. You don't know
how desperate they're going to be. They basically your attacker's risk reward mindset could
be all over the place. They could be willing to take a really big risk for a really small
reward. Whereas we would expect a more rational person would only want to take a small risk
for a larger award, but you never know. And of course, you know, it could be a simple
crime of opportunity of someone who is otherwise destitute or, you know, maybe has some huge
death that they have to pay off very quickly. Otherwise something bad is going to happen
to them. You know, you never know what someone's particular situation is going to be. So along
that, that same mindset, you know, if we're talking about, you know, should we have a
decoy wallet, then what, what we're really saying is we're speculating around, you know,
what the payoff that this person will be satisfied with. And I have no way of speculating that
because once again, we have no idea of what the attacker's profile is going to be. So
I generally assume, you know, the worst case scenario is that they, like you said before,
they may have gained some information that gives them an expectation of a certain amount
of value that you have. And if you offer them a small fraction of that, they may only get
angrier and do, you know, worse things out of sort of retaliation. So I am, I'm not a
fan of decoy wallets, but also I don't have any real world information because as far
as I'm aware from all of these physical attacks that I have cataloged, I have never heard
of a situation where someone said, Oh, I had a decoy wallet and I gave them that and they
left. And it's possible that that has happened. And the person just didn't want to admit that
later because it would have made them a target again. But we just don't know. We there's
first of all, there's so few data points as it is, like I said, less than 100 data points
that we're aware of. I'm sure there are far more incidents we're not aware of, but if
we're just doing this, you know, based upon the facts of what we know, the short version
is I have no idea and I don't like speculating. I like being conservative.
Well, it doesn't matter what is your choice. It feels like you will always get beaten.
And even if you try to convince them that you only have one Bitcoin, you can try to
lie to them. Like this is all what I have, but you will probably get beaten. You can
always, you can try to be reasonable and tell them I have 10, but I'm only able to give
you right now one. You probably will get beaten. So I think that if, if they, if they, yeah,
at least there is a maybe, you know, but once they are in and once they have this purpose
to attack you, I think that they will harm you. So it's a, then this takes me to another
place that is another possibility that is, okay, you can make it impossible to access
the Bitcoin. And here you have different systems. Here is possible. I yeah, probably where,
where Casa comes in, you can create a multisig, for example, and one key, you have it with
Casa and the other two, you can access them, but not immediately. You have them somewhere
else. You have even, even one can be in a, in a, in a bank. There are other possibilities.
You can trust the custody of your funds to a third party. What do you think about that
of locking all your funds somewhere?
So there's a couple of ways to look at this, of course. I think we're kind of focusing
on the immediate issue of harm and trying to just, you know, pay someone off essentially
by your safety back, at least temporarily. That's one way of looking at it. My way, I
guess, first of all, I, I hate even the idea of potentially being a victim. And I guess
I would, I would rather go down with the ship as it were, and, and die knowing that my attacker
got nothing. I think that would, you know, please me more because I just, I hate the
idea of having someone successfully pull off an attack against me. But you know, even putting
those like individual perspectives aside, because neither, neither perspective is right
or wrong. It's just, you know, your own opinions on, you know, what you're willing to have
happen. The, I think the broader issue is one of the entire ecosystem. And like one
of the reasons why I'm such a big proponent of, of really strong self custody is that
like we said, this is a risk reward type of situation that criminals are evaluating. And
at a really high level, you know, as Bitcoin adoption continues to increase, this is a
constantly changing risk reward profile where Bitcoin goes more mainstream. The result of
that is that more people adopt Bitcoin. The secondary result of that is that more criminals
or more people who are willing to hurt people start thinking about Bitcoin holders and how
to attack them and what they might get out of them. And if we as Bitcoin holders want
to discourage attacks against us, then we don't want to essentially set precedents.
We don't want to create a default system that is easy for these wrench attacks to happen.
So, you know, if wrench attacks start becoming more and more common, and the criminals are
essentially getting more and more money as a result of them, then that's going to create
a trend I believe that will be very hard to push back against. I think it's much better
if we have the vast majority of self custody Bitcoin people in a situation where they are
able to repel these attacks. And as a result, the criminal element starts to see the risk
reward as being a higher risk with a lower chance of success. This is kind of, you know,
a hand wavy, it's not a quantifiable thing. It's more of a trying to steer the whole direction
of the security of the ecosystem.
And in those lines, there is also another theory in the community that is not privacy,
but the opposite, to be completely open about how are you storing your Bitcoin. Imagine
that I say, no, no, no, I don't have access to my keys. And to move any Bitcoin, I have
to have a call with CASA and they have to see that everything is okay, let's say, or
I have to request and it's 24 hour delay. And I'm completely clear on it. So that nobody
thinks that I'm a candidate for an attack. What do you think about that?
Yeah. So I don't know if this is just an American thing, but have you ever been in a store or
at least in America, it's usually gas stations or stores that are open 24 hours a day, you
know, and at higher risk of like a nighttime robbery. But there's a number of these type
of stores where they will have signs that say, you know, cashier only has $50 and all
the money gets put into the safe, you know, every 12 hours and the safe is on a timer
that can only be open like once a week with the right key. And they put that sign at the
very front. So, you know, this as a, like you said, a sort of transparent security mechanism,
there is good precedent for this, there is reason to believe that that will dissuade
a lot of people. And so, you know, saying, if you're going to go the route of saying
being like a publicly known Bitcoin holder, which, you know, there are reasons to do that,
if you want to help the adoption of the ecosystem, then you're saying, you know, this Bitcoin
holder does not have access or does not have direct access to their keys, to their funds.
It's the same type of thing. And that ought to dissuade most people. You know, maybe someone
will choose not to believe you and try anyways. But I think putting that type of security
statement upfront, I don't really see any downsides from it if you're already open about
being a Bitcoin holder.
This is a very interesting point. And then also another topic that we spoke a lot was
about lock times. Some members were saying that they believe lock times are the way because
even and even to publish it, not like, hey, my funds are under lock time, so that an attacker
doesn't want to attack them. In my opinion, I'm not a very big fan, but I wanted to know
what's your opinion on lock times.
Yeah, I'm not a fan for multiple reasons. The first reason is there simply are not many
Bitcoin wallets that make that a user friendly feature. The next reason is that if you do
put your funds into a lock time address, then you have to have some mechanism to keep renewing
that. So it becomes a question of, are you locking them for a month, six months, a year,
10 years? And then if so, how do you ensure that you relock them as soon as they become
unlocked? There's also issues around recovery of these wallets. Whenever you start putting
lock times into the redeem scripts of a Bitcoin address, you're creating non-deterministic
data, which means you can no longer recover your money with only the seed phrase. So you're
now going to have to start creating backups with other data. And once again, and I've
played around with this a little bit, and I'm just not aware of any wallets that make
it very easy for you to reconstruct lock time addresses, especially if there's multiple
different lock times on your different addresses. And then, I mean, I'm sure it could come up
with a lot of things, but the one final thing is, okay, let's assume a situation where you
have your keys, your seed, all the stuff you need to recreate your wallet, and you get
wrench attacked and they take all of it. What happens when that lock time gets surpassed?
Well now, if the attacker took the only copy of your stuff, they just sweep the funds once
it becomes unlocked. If you had multiple copies, and you load up and reconstitute your wallet,
and they've reconstituted your wallet, then at the time that it becomes unlocked, both
of you essentially enter into a race to try to sweep those funds. And it sort of becomes
a race to the bottom. So effectively, what you could see happen from a technical standpoint
is both you and the attacker basically creating, replaced by fee transactions that are offering
higher and higher or minor fees to get a fast confirmation on those funds. And think of
it of the attacker really has nothing to lose. So they would be willing to spend 99% of your
money in fees if it meant they got 1%. So it doesn't hold up very well, I think, in
adversarial situations. It also makes, I believe, the chance of loss due to just user error
a lot higher. And that's, you know, we're spending this entire episode, of course, talking
about physical attackers, but I do want to make it very clear that in the grand scheme
of things, you're far more likely to screw up and just simply lock yourself out of your
own money than you are to have someone physically attack you for your keys.
Yeah, I said that I'm not a big fan of lock times, basically because of a fee race. I
believe that if you don't include the lock time inside the redeem script, then it's public
to everyone when is the lock time finishing, no? Am I right in this?
Well, I mean, there's multiple, okay, so there's multiple ways to do lock times. And I'm assuming
that you're going to use the check lock time verify way, which means that you basically
have a redeem script that has either the block height or the timestamp in, I think, milliseconds
or seconds in the redeem script. So that, you know, the address, the Bitcoin address
that gets seen publicly on the blockchain where you deposit into it, you know, that's
a hash of the redeem script. So nobody knows what that actual block height or timestamp
is until you spend from that address. So that means, of course, you have to be storing that
information somewhere yourself if you want to be able to reconstitute and spend from
the wallet.
Yeah. And if not, because this is what was coming to my mind, there is this in every
transaction, there is this parameter of lock time, I think is the last four bytes of every
transaction normally set to 0000. But I suppose that that can be that could be used outside
the redeem script, but then...
So that is the in lock time parameter, which has been around for quite a long time. However,
it may be that people get confused because, like I said, there's three different types
of time locks in Bitcoin and they all do different things. The in lock time that is public on
every transaction, that means that the transaction is not valid to be published, broadcast and
confirmed before that specific time. So if you're using that type of lock on your transaction,
it's not actually...
It doesn't even propagate.
Well, yeah. So the way that you would have to do that type of lock time is what you're
really doing. It only really works if you're creating a pre-signed transaction that is
spending money to go somewhere. And there are a lot of cool things that you can do with
that. You can start creating these different transaction chains that move money around
and basically creating a vaulting protocol. But I believe that is generally not what people
are thinking about when they say, I want to lock time all of my money. And what they really
want in that case is the check lock time verify functionality, which goes into the redeem
script.
Are you excited about covenants?
I mean, covenants are something people have been talking about for many years and it's
still kind of vague and hand wavy. And so for me, it's all about practicality. One of
the potential downsides, of course, is just more complexity. Whenever you're introducing
more complexity, there's more things that can potentially go wrong. But I'm keeping
track of these different projects. I think there's the revolt project. And then you can
do Jeremy Rubin is doing some interesting things with his SAPO project. And I guess
it's the check template verify opcode that he's trying to get more support for. But at
the end of the day, it's going to come down to what can we kind of standardize around?
What makes sense? What's robust and simple enough that doesn't introduce complexity and
foot guns where people can shoot themselves in the foot? That's one of the things at CASA
where we have purposefully avoided adding a lot of the more advanced functionality into
CASA because there's generally a lot of ways that it can be, I would say misused to the
user's detriment. So that's why, for example, we don't have lock time stuff in CASA because
it would end up creating a lot more complexity around managing the UTXOs, managing the time
locks, managing backups, and being able to recreate wallets outside of CASA. In general,
I think that the potential downsides outweigh the upsides.
And now that you mentioned CASA, how does a CASA user benefit in the case of a $5 branch
attack?
Well, so we've had actually a handful of users who have been robbed in different ways over
the years, and CASA has successfully prevented funds from being lost from their CASA setup.
We have had users that have essentially been coerced into opening up their exchange wallets
and withdrawing all the money from there. But what it really comes down to is the fact
that the client does not have enough keys on them at the time that they're attacked.
And I don't know specific, or at least most of these situations, I think, robberies occurred
when they were not home. And of course, there's just not enough key material in the home for
the wallet to be spent from.
But in one case where we had a client who was actually physically drugged and coerced
into moving their money, the fact that they didn't have the keys on them, I think, was
what really was their saving grace. And that even though the attacker got the phone and
was able to withdraw all the money from the different apps that they had on their phone,
they couldn't do it from CASA because they only had the mobile key. They only had one
of the five keys for that client.
As a final question, I wanted to ask you, if somebody asked you what would be the most
important advice when you want to self-custody your life-saving Bitcoin, what would you
tell them?
Well, there are many different forms of both attack and loss that you have to be worried
about. And like I said, you should be more worried about losing access to your keys than
you should about having them stolen from you. As soon as you get to the point where you're
keeping your keys offline on hardware devices, you're pretty safe against the common forms
of hacking. And then it comes down to, well, what happens if some sort of disaster occurs
where we start losing access to keys?
So you then have to just think about what is every possible thing that could go wrong?
What if the house burns down? What if there is a flood? You should assume that any given
location that you're keeping key material in can be destroyed or compromised. And so
you just want to have multiple redundant backups of that key material that are distributed
widely enough that you're comfortable that no single incident will wipe enough of them
out.
And then once you get to that level of robustness, the final thing that I think a lot of people
don't consider because I think a lot of the adopters in this space are still fairly young
is that you also need to worry about yourself being a point of failure. None of us know
how long we're going to be around. You could get hit by a truck crossing the street. What
happens in a situation like that where you are incapacitated or coerced like we've spent
a lot of time talking about, but really incapacitated is far more likely, can your loved ones then
access your money?
And that is where things can get a lot more complicated because you start having to balance
a very fine line between assuring that only you have access to your keys, but also assuring
that specific other people have access to them if you're no longer able to access them
yourself. And so that's where you want to think about inheritance. Generally, I recommend
people read Pamela Morgan's Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning Guide. I'm not sure if it's been
translated.
It's about to be published in Spanish. So Andreas, yesterday, doing a tweet about it.
Perfect. So once that gets published, definitely read that. I myself learned a lot from that
book when I was thinking through it, simply because I wasn't familiar with a lot of the
edge cases around estate planning and things that can go wrong there. But over the past
year or two, that's also something that we've spent a lot of time at CASA thinking about
both from a technical standpoint and a legal standpoint of how do you build key and wallet
recovery into the estate planning process and how do you make sure that it's bulletproof
because you don't want to create a fragile system that you never test. And then once
you're gone, your family gets together and tries to figure out how to follow your instructions
and finds that they don't know how and they essentially can't recover your money.
They are not pirates and they don't want to be looking for the treasure for many years.
No, I did a podcast about that book and I covered it quite deeply. And yeah, it's great.
It's great. It will be a great opportunity to have it in Spanish.
Jameson, thank you very much for this talk. Hope that this clarifies a lot of the questions
that I have been reading lately and that maybe pushes some people to think about CASA or
to think about other security measures that will keep their Bitcoin safe. Thank you for
joining.
Thanks for having me.

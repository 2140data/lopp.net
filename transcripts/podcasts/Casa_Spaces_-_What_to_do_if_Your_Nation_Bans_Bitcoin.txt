Okay, looks like we're all here. Thank you everyone for joining us. This is John with
CASA, the safest way to store your Bitcoin and we really appreciate you taking the time
to sit in on this topic. What to do if your nation bans Bitcoin? It means different things
all around the world and of course many nations are at varying stages of this debate right
now and this will be a great conversation and a wonderful time for it. We're pleased
to welcome our speakers Ron Stoner and Jameson Lopp both with CASA and our special guests
NVK or Rodolfo as some of you may know him from CoinKite as well as Dave Bradley from
the Bitcoin Well and so thank you so much for joining us and before we begin I would
like to remind everyone that this is going to be a theoretical discussion. We obviously
don't know where you live around the world and so we are not offering legal advice, tax
advice or financial advice. This is all theory and we hope you enjoy this discussion. But
speakers if you could take turns and kind of tell us a little bit about yourself. Sure,
I'll start. My name is Ron Stoner. I'm a hacker that has been in this space for over a decade
now and I transitioned into more of the professional side of security. I'm currently the head of
security at CASA helping to provide our customers the peace of mind they need when it comes
to their security in Bitcoin and one of the fun parts of my job is thinking about these
types of attacks and the response and what to do and how to help people secure their
holdings. So this is a really fun topic. I'm happy to be here and elated to be on this
panel with the rest of our guests. I think I'll turn that over to Jameson. Hi, I've
been building multi SIG self custody Bitcoin wallets for about seven years now and originally
my thesis many years ago for why I first got interested in Bitcoin was actually as a hedge
against nation states and central banks and basically the idea of having a completely
alternative parallel financial system. So I think this is one of the fundamental aspects
of the system that a lot of us are here for in the first place and the ability for Bitcoin
to be able to not only survive but thrive despite what the traditional authorities would
like us to do is it's important for us to keep in mind and continue discussing as the
whole world keeps evolving and responding to the fact that Bitcoin continues to exist.
Hey, NVK founded CoinKite over 10 years ago. We've been defending people's bags since then
in multiple iterations. Right now we make a cold card which is a very hardened hardware
wallet and we make a few other Bitcoin products and yeah we just make sure that people don't
lose money. Hey, I'm Dave Bradley. I've been in Bitcoin since late 2010 and I founded my
first Bitcoin company in 2013 and I've been buying and selling Bitcoin in Canada ever
since. Most currently I'm with a company called Bitcoin Well. We do primarily Bitcoin ATMs
and we're publicly traded on the Toronto Venture Stock Exchange and I'm also widely known as
the strongest and best looking Bitcoin entrepreneur in Canada. Perfect. Thank you so much for
joining us. So I'd like to open up by acknowledging a little bit of the elephant in the room.
Obviously this topic is timely for a very important reason. In Canada we're seeing some
events where the government is getting to interact with Bitcoin in a way that a lot
of us aren't used to. So Dave and NVK, if you could, what's the read from where you're
standing from people that live there? So you know like these things are not exactly how
the media portrays and also they're much worse and much better in certain ways. I mean first
of all there is no like order or law or anything that I know of against Bitcoin itself. The
concern was with this specific crowdfunding platform that was crowdfunding after the order
to stop was made. Essentially the government made donating to this cause illegal. It's
unlikely the outstanding court after all this martial law is done and whatever but that's
beside the point. Point is they made it illegal to donate to this cause and they weren't able
to distribute those funds to the truckers as far as I know and then what the government
has is a list of addresses really and they're sort of like trying to tell through the usual
sort of ways of telling all the governed say KYC exchanges and things like listen these
addresses are addresses of interest. We would like you to stop if you have any transactions
related to this. I don't believe they were successful in any of those cases and I don't
think there was any success regarding lightning at all. So that's sort of like the just objective
state of things. Yeah so like Rodolfo said like all of the regulated companies got the
same notice. We got that notice from the RCMP and there's I think there's like 34 addresses
on there. What they notice notably is not is any requirement to do any kind of blockchain
analysis to go back and see you know did this person just move these coins from one of those
addresses so it's not necessarily the most effective way to ban those addresses but it's
definitely the first time I think that we've seen like an organized effort to actively
try to freeze Bitcoin in Canada. They have sent those or if it comes from this address
you're sort of like required to stop it but I don't think they're sophisticated enough
to understand you know the millions of ways in which people circumvent those orders. Yeah
I think the big differentiator is like every other time that we've been asked to freeze
addresses that I know of or that anyone's been asked to freeze addresses it's always
been tied to like a police investigation or a court order or something like that rather
than just like a blanket government edict and so it's a little different in terms of
how they got to this place I think. Thank you. So something that's on my mind about
this topic is the situation in Canada we're seeing something involving in Russia with
a bill that could be prohibiting self custody. I'm not a lawyer in Russia so I don't know
for sure but has Bitcoin always been on a collision course with this type of this type
of outright ban or really stringent regulation? I think in my mind the risk of some of the
bans and regulation were greater in the beginning of Bitcoin's history. What I mean by that
is the hydro hadn't grown large yet and I think we're at a point now where if you end
up cutting off one of the heads three or more are definitely going to grow in its place.
So when we talk about regulation and bans a lot of people immediately go to the worst
case scenario and what we've seen over history is the running joke on Reddit is that China
has banned Bitcoin 18 times now. Some of them were a little bit more effective than others
some of them were just PR for PR reasons and when we're talking about bans there's really
a couple levels of bans where they could declare a ban from a country level without really
any enforcement where they're just declaring that and hoping people comply. You could also
see a ban where they're doing things that were referenced here where there's white address
lists and things that they need to block or there may be transactions that are being flagged
and stopped to and from exchanges and service providers and then you can go a little bit
further where it can reach out to your bank accounts now is what we're seeing if you transacted
with Bitcoin and we saw this in the past where people would use bank accounts and a certain
service provider or company would ban them because they were associated with Bitcoin
and activity and then we can even go further where we can talk about the miners and hashing
power and a lot of the censorship capabilities there that people have theorized about. So
I think it's interesting to me today because it is an issue but I think that the hydro
like I said has grown so large that we're going to be able to pivot and react if we
start to see these things depending on the level of man.
I guess one thing that we've been seeing here is and I think it's a great example because
it is a G7 country and G7 countries you'd think would be the last to sort of do something
so stupid and one fascinating thing to watch is it is very similar to like a chavian sort
of way of handling it where you essentially put a massive blanketing order out or new
law and then what you do is you do selective enforcement which is traditionally how it's
been done in governments forever where the government in place normally goes after people
who they don't like with that selective enforcement because ultimately they know it is impossible
to ban it so it's down to nonsense or for you to know that you are a person who's not
on their happy list so you may find yourself in a position where you may need to either
fight them in court or leave.
Yeah I think specifying exactly what type of ban we're talking about is important because
there are many types of bans that can't really be enforced like I don't think we're going
to see for example an attempt to completely ban bitcoin as a protocol at the network level
that would be kind of ridiculous to do because once again bitcoin as a communications protocol
can be facilitated over any number of different media as actually Rodolfo is well aware you
know having done some experiments on censorship resistance and alternative communications
channels and ultimately you know one of the reasons why there is this narrative that bitcoin
can't be banned is because it comes down to these sort of boots on the ground like number
of doors that need to be kicked down in order to really enforce this and so that's why especially
if we are successful in continuing to increase the level of self-custody getting the funds
into the hands of the individuals rather than a few centralized choke points that's what
makes bitcoin more and more robust because it becomes less and less likely that a nation
state is going to care so much about this financial network that is you know flagrantly
continuing to operate despite their proclamations that they're going to you know send law enforcement
and military to the home of every suspected bitcoin user yeah I mean remember right like
people can just pack up and leave right they'll remember their 12 words and they'll leave
literally naked you know if we're still talking about say g20 kind of country it's unlikely
they will hold hostage you know like thousands of people just because they are suspected
to have you know bitcoin yeah I think we're talking about like what kind of ban is likely
in the short term I think what they're going to end up trying to do here in Canada and
I can see this happening in other western nations soon is imposing further censorship
requirements onto the centralized exchanges so I think we're probably going to be in a
space where as regulated companies we have to block certain addresses we have to block
an ever increasing list of people and just like any government attempt to ban anything
anywhere else in the world what's that that's going to do is drive the formation of a black
market and I don't really see there being a lot of success at stopping people who really
want to get bitcoin to getting bitcoin that's I don't see going any better than their attempts
to ban drugs differentiator that we have currently that we didn't have prior is that we're seeing
nations and micro nations and sovereign states start to adopt it so if we do see bands from
a nation's type of level from these different countries does that mean El Salvador for example
is going to follow suit or are they going to continue to do their own thing we didn't
necessarily have that before so as bitcoin grows and the community matures we're seeing
more of this foundation be built where you know I think eventually you may get to a point
where we can say it doesn't matter if this country bans it because you know this is our
tool it's a global tool it wasn't designed for government's censorship or seizure and
I think we can continue to work to fulfill that prophecy you know it's you can look at
financial markets as molt right so you know when a country makes a you know a ban or something
against an asset right there is a financial consequence to that if a lot of people hold
that asset especially if the financial markets hold that asset right so as bitcoin gets more
adopted by say fortune 500 companies right a government banning bitcoin say for example
american government so big banning bitcoin would you know crash a lot of this stocks
that have a lot of bitcoin their balance sheets say in the near future so you know nobody
gets reelected if they crash the market so you know that's why it's so good that you
have these entities adopting bitcoin yeah I think we're a long way from them trying
to aggressively fully ban bitcoin I think that we might get that to that point someday
where all these attacks at the pool and at the minor level start becoming a realistic
possibility but I don't think they're going to ban those things I don't think they're
going to go that far over censorship I think that the only thing that's going to get the
nation states of the world to eventually go that far is once they realize that they've
permanently lost the ability to tax us through inflation then that's what I would expect
to be a last ditch effort to regain some measure of control we should also as bitcoin evolves
and matures they need to be specific about what is actually being banned right so are
we talking about mainnet are we talking about something like the lightning network that
was mentioned earlier because if I'm running my own full node I have the capability to
open peer-to-peer payment channels and still transact in some some cases so I may not be
able to settle on a mainnet if there's issues or bands or things going on but if I have
liquidity and I have access I can still use some of these tools so my challenge would
be when these bands come up what specifically is being banned is it everything under one
umbrella or specific pieces of the protocol and they think that complexity is going to
grow over time as we see more bits implemented more features and more tools built on top
of bitcoin yeah just like anything else I expect the government will not be very good
at this and they will probably be a number of years behind on whatever they're whatever
layer or new technology they're trying to ban and just like we saw with the men's check
response there I can see them trying to ban things that they can't physically ban yeah
I think we have finally the first type of technology that you truly shoot yourself in
the foot if you go after it right you know even the internet nowadays you know as a g20
interconnected financially country you can shut off the internet right that's something
reserved for for say developing world or poor countries because they're simply not that
interconnected now when you have an asset that on top of the internet you know you can
still transact even without the internet just with more you know nonsenses but you now have
something that you're economically linked right that the actual value that your citizens
your companies have is fully linked with the rest of the world in market so you can't just
debase say your currency like you did before you cannot just debase the bitcoin you have
to you know maybe have a new trade agreement or something so you know you just since anymore
or even what you know a lot of these countries did with gold you can't create paper bitcoin
the same way you did a paper gold that you know the supply is just too small and it will
be sort of fairly clear that somebody's trying to play that so I think the days of blanket
bans are pretty much done thank you so um a good question to think about is is if you
kind of put yourself in the shoes of your average bitcoin or maybe even a new bit corner
and if you're somebody that's a little bit worried about this type of outright ban or
something really strict coming down on you what types of things should be should you
be looking for in your current regime I mean I think the the easiest way to go about your
life adopting bitcoin and doing it in a way that is not susceptible to authoritarian overreach
is to to try to be you know native within the ecosystem and by native I mean like try
to avoid these choke points which are the you know the regulated on and off ramps because
like we've already said we know that that is where the government pressure is going
to end up because the government or really any any authority is going to try to exert
the maximum amount of control that they can with the least amount of effort so that's
why choke points and bottlenecks centralized areas of any ecosystem that's that's where
the pressure gets put so if if you are you know acting as a sort of full native bitcoin
or trying to you know help create a more circular economy or you're accepting bitcoin for stuff
you're you're paying for things with bitcoin then I think that's going to automatically
put you in the best possible position now it's you know it's a bit more challenging
to do because we're still very early I think in the process of mainstreaming the bitcoin
economy but I think that really is the end goal if we we want people to be able to utilize
the technology and the protocol without having all of these weak points which are essentially
the the bridges between the traditional financial system and this new one you know it's kind
of fascinating because you know stable coins essentially deprecated the proverbial Swiss
bank accounts to for for your USD stable needs right so now you know you find people you
know lawfully engaging in you know like full-on banking services outside of the the legacy
financial system right they're able to travel the world have USD have Bitcoin and and you
know they can interchange between the two they can find some more complex riskier contracts
out there to resolve some of the other volatility issues but no but we are moving to a point
now where in just a few more years you know you're going to find credit card solutions
you're going to find still things that you may need to interface with the old world that
you know will be sort of whack-a-mole but but you you will be sufficiently serviced
with the new financial solutions that may be or may not be regulated and there is almost
nothing governments can do about that because these people can also just move I think we're
going to see a point where they force stablecoin operators or the protocols that they're on
to regulate the users or transactions yeah but but that wouldn't matter right that that
only matters if people are trying to go back to the legacy system right if they find like
you knew him for the you know if they find a landlord that sucks that's willing to accept
you know the direct asset like Bitcoin or some stablecoin as payment for the the rent
you know that exchange they had the capabilities or the requirements of blocking that payment
is no longer relevant but there's still an operator of the stablecoin right somebody
issued that sure sure you know and that's today but at the same time I mean how many
tether transactions have been censored like nearly none and and you know what's going
to happen is as some of this this more riskier assets on riskier chains evolve and grow you're
going to have you know USD based on Chinese treasuries right and and people are just going
to keep on hopping between all these if their intent is to escape volatility with higher
risk but at the same time they can just hold you know BTC or they can just pay BTC to the
landlord so you know I think there's going to be a weird space in the next few years
on how lawful people behave and how lawful people resolve some of the issues because
the advantage is going to be on the people who just move on from the state actor sort
of lawful mentality not advocating for that but but that's really where the market is
going because state actors just can't move or can let go of that control I think there
are some things people can do until we get to that point where there are enough decentralized
financial services to be able to live and survive and I asked myself the same question
or similar questions before this space you know what actions would I take or what would
I do to prepare if they came back and said the United States has banned all Bitcoin right
and you have to cease using it immediately and one that I think are viable methods that
you can do if you are one of these people that's facing a ban or you're in one of these
nations that decides to enact this is one of the more viable methods is you can sit
tight I think I would immediately make sure I have GPG encrypted copies of my private
keys or my seeds and I would keep that somewhere hidden and I probably would just lay low until
the legislation or everything worked out but then the other thing I think people should
be aware of I'm a paranoid security guy so I always try to think about this stuff right
in the worst case scenario and then hope for the best but from a preparation standpoint
there's six or seven things people can do to prepare for this if you are worried about
it and I think the first one we saw up in Canada is if your bank account is being linked
to Bitcoin activity or transactions that could be suspect to being frozen.
So this was one of the steps that people used to do in the early days is that they had multiple
bank accounts if you have that luxury where if one of your bank accounts goes down you're
not totally dead in the water you're spreading that risk out a little bit and that's something
people could do today before the banks happen.
The other thing you can do is keep your non KYC coins in cold storage and some good examples
of non KYC coins would be ways that you've mined yourself or if you're lucky enough to
hold physical Bitcoin casacious coins or some of those tokens and representations those
physical totems those coins haven't moved in years and haven't gone through KYC systems
and aren't associated with any transaction activity so adding those types of things I
think are going to demand a premium when we do see these types of regulations and bans
and they do today currently just due to some of the checks exchanges do.
I also recommend people keep some liquidity in some lightning wallets maybe not a ton
because it's still a new technology and we're working out a lot of the issues but if you
have money in the lightning wallet and we do see a ban on main net there may be code
there may be things we can do with being able to still transact or settle those on a new
chain.
Number four is kind of touchy where you do want to make sure you have enough funds in
your local fiat currency for an emergency and what I mean by that is enough to eat and
potentially move and get to somewhere where you can reload your seeds on a hardware wallet
or transact with your Bitcoin in another country and then the other thing people should do
is just practice safe operational security OPSEC if your government's banning Bitcoin
and they're serious about it they're going to be grabbing logs and keywords off your
Facebook your LinkedIn your Twitter and trying to identify those people as we said selective
enforcement right there were the whales who are the known vocal personalities in this
space who are the people that are throwing the middle finger to the government because
they're going to make an example out of them to try to get everybody else in line.
So these are the types of things I think people need to think about and lastly you are a type
of person that has enough money and availability for dual citizenship right there you're decentralizing
your risks to a one nation that's Bitcoin. You can go to your other nation and transact
and do what you need to do without having to worry about running amok of that ban or
the government.
So I've got an interesting exercise and we'll see what the response is to this. So imagine
you wake up tomorrow and some and through some weird twist of fate you're a central
banker and your premier president has told you to crack down on Bitcoin. How would you
attack it?
I think from a central bank perspective the best way to go after Bitcoin would be going
back to the gold standard.
It's totally true I mean there really isn't much because the financial incentives are
really on side of Bitcoin right. This is one of those moments that you can choose to embrace
it and take advantage of it and be a first comer and really benefit from being that first
comer or you're just going to essentially try to fight and perish. It sounds a little
too optimistic or too strong but that's really what this is.
I think I would provoke in fighting within the community because that's the typical
spy playbook is cause dissension from within distract people keep their eyes off the mission
and the prize and these examples in the community are ones that we should all look at and rally
behind because this is our chance to stand united and say no we won't stand for these
bans no we won't stand for these types of regulations. This is our tool right. This
is how we're going to use it. So these are eye opening examples but if I was to do that
I would try to do some some spy ops from inside.
I mean we saw that right. I mean they feel miserably trying to change variables and you
know sure they caused a little bit of strife but people eventually move on and I think
the size of the space now and the amount of of of economical capacity sort of you know
negates all this sort of like usual approach they have always done against open source
right which is you know try to create drama.
I don't know I would I would probably investigate market manipulation. I mean if you think about
it with the central banks essentially having the money printer it seems like if you really
wanted to you could probably you know take on the position of being the most malicious
huge Bitcoin whale market maker in existence.
I mean it would be pretty funny if they printed a lot bought a lot and then dumped.
Yeah the problem with that idea is that you just give more power to the Bitcoiners while
you're doing that right because you increase all of our purchasing power as they drive
the person.
That's an interesting segue to my next question. So for those that aren't familiar with it
what is the Streisand effect and how would that interact with Bitcoin? Why is the Streisand
effect take place?
You can't cheat the market right. I mean there's only so far you can do and that is true for
the market of ideas of or you know financial assets. It's just that we have a thing that
everybody wants and governments are now at odds with the markets right. They're trying
to go the other way with censorship and manipulation of markets but we now have this thing that
forces their hand. So essentially every time they try to do something with it it just strikes
an effect and something else bigger happens right. Like it's not perfect akin but you
know they just can't delete Bitcoin off the internet anymore.
Yeah I mean once it gets big enough that they can't ignore it they have to start issuing
these proclamations right and so the proclamations inevitably result in the Streisand effect
because now the media picks up on it and of course they're gonna start spinning it and
put their narrative on it. I think one of the most annoying things that I've seen from
the past few weeks is I saw quite a few mainstream media articles that said that the Canadian
government had frozen a bunch of Bitcoin wallets and of course we all know that's not the case.
They only proclaimed that they wished that they could freeze a bunch of Bitcoin wallets.
A good historical example of the Streisand effect is when China did their most recent
ban in October and it came out in the news and everyone thought it was going to be doom
and gloom and the price actually rose. So we saw some of the highest price activity
whether it was correlated or not. Something tells me the news stories and people's awareness
of all of that got them moving a little bit quicker. So I think that's a good example
of the inverse effect happening.
Yeah I'm probably in you know several hundred or maybe thousands of people's phones as Bitcoin
Dave and I'm the guy that they text I'm sure the rest of you guys all have this as well
where every person you've ever met texts you anytime something happens to do with Bitcoin
and usually what ends up happening is those people text when the price is going way up
but this week I've been getting a lot of those texts because I think people are starting
to see you know what is actually useful about Bitcoin and what kind of like real world scenario
you can like a normal person can end up in where they might want money that the government
can't freeze.
Yeah I mean you know look at what Trudeau did with the bank freezes right they had to
try to walk that back because the net effect of this kind of stuff is that you know any
person with a brain goes hey if they can arbitrarily you know pick on some old lady because she
donated 20 bucks to some cause that she doesn't even fully understand right you know they're
going to come after my actual wealth and so these people all started to wiring out.
I mean you know you ask around like anybody with money was starting to get the money out
of the country right and what's fascinating about that is that you can't really save face
after something like that it's going to take years for people to have any sort of security
or respect for the Canadian banking system.
How would the risk of a ban how does it differ from those that have KYC coins and those who
don't have KYC coins what is the practical impact of that?
Say another layer in my mind of privacy and security where I have my holdings and I secure
them how I want and I take custody of those and nobody needs to know whereas if I've interacted
with an exchange that has my KYC information any government or legal entity can compel
them to share that information without my knowledge and that does happen as we referenced
earlier in the call with different law enforcement requests and seizures and things that happen.
So I would advise people that if you're the type of person that is privacy or security
conscious to not interact with these KYC sites and services we've been preaching that for
a while and even Kraken just came out and said recently that is happening and it's going
to continue to happen as time goes on.
So it's another layer in the security and privacy onion of how far do you want to go
and what level of control do you want to retain over your assets?
Coming after the exchanges is the only knob governments have.
So they're going to turn that one all the way to a hundred and people can still legally
buy it.
I doubt they will be legalized to buy it.
They're just going to have like further reporting sort of requirements and as people take custody
of them it's so important to take custody of your bitcoins because not your keys not
your coins.
You can weather it out as Ron mentioned you know just sit and wait because if you don't
do anything more often than not you will likely be in a legal position where you're not breaking
any laws or doing anything of course check with your lawyer but like so you know Bitcoin
is playing the weight game right.
We can cockroach we can stay we can hold longer that they can stay solvent.
I think that that was also still true even after all of the Chinese bans you know even
after I think they basically forced most of the exchanges to shut down.
If I recall correctly it was still legal to own Bitcoin and transact in it.
It's just that they basically shut off all of the regulated financial institution on
ramps and off ramps.
I think a good question to ask yourself too we always like to ask like what if your nation
bans Bitcoin what if your nation bans your local currency like what if the United States
comes out and says the dollar is no longer a currency where the world decides that we're
not going to transact in the dollar anymore and when you think about it what steps would
you take immediately or what systems would collapse or what would end up happening I
think that's how I got it with Bitcoin like what steps would I take to make sure I can
ensure my survivability for the short term and the long term if the inverse was to happen.
You know when I was a kid in Brazil the government went and did the bailings right did a haircut
and that was right after I think two or three failed currencies that we had only 24 hours
to exchange back to the new currency you know this is the game that you know these are these
are the tools in the game that they know how to play right the difference now is that we
have an asset that's fully fungible and fully soluble right and I think they you know to
a certain extent they do understand that I don't think they are in a position yet or
do not see the bright side of essentially acknowledging that Bitcoin is not banable
and that there is very little much that they can do nowadays against capital controls right
so you know just being able to secure your asset goes a long way yeah I think they're
already kind of on the road to that right now with all the money printing going on in
the world it just hasn't really registered yet that these currencies are dying and the
difference is this time we can switch to the new money well in advance so we don't only
have 24 hours for some reference right even in Canada you know like I would I would sort
of go out on a limb and say that like at least probably half of the of the wealthy who have
liquidity liquid money in the bank are actually holding USD right I don't think non-businesses
hold CAD as much as people think they do so even if we saw the capital flight out you
would see it as USD and you wouldn't see it reflected in the CAD being sort of demolished
in the forex right so that's not different than all these people holding the BTC like
you would not be clear to them what's happening I think a lot of the stuff is not as visible
anymore to government as they think that it is something else that that we're seeing making
headlines right now is the prospect of banning self-custody and the only analog I can think
of that is is when when you travel across the country with hordes of cash and and you
get stopped and the police takes it from you when we think about banning self-custody we're
looking at civil forfeiture are we like are they messing with the supply chain on hardware
wallets what would you anticipate is is their goal that's my challenge so that is how do
you enforce it at that level where you know do we have to send Gestapo to people's houses
to do searches one of the things that I remember vividly from my childhood was the cable television
de-scramblers right you would go over your friend's house or your uncle's house and
they'd have that little black box it would give you all the pay-per-view channels on
cable and the whole channel guide and everything he scrambled and it was just a chip and they
thought that for years the cable company did because they said they were losing revenue
and in reality you know they were making profits hand over fist but every once in a while they'd
send out a stinger signal or send out a cable technician to do some surveillance and check
to see if anybody was using those but I remember for years for decades at least people got
away with that right because you can't enforce that on that low level and I doubt that they're
going to be training police to be able to identify hardware wallets and USB drives and
things like that as we mentioned earlier the government's slow they're inefficient they
may eventually get their way but they're not very good at doing things you know it's kind
of funny because you know we actually make hardware wallets in Canada and and it's I'm
still fully unconcerned because you know it's still a lawful country I'm entitled to make
a product they've tried a banning encryption before back in the day how did that work didn't
work so you know they can't really replace the chips that we have in quantity good luck
to them the source code is is totally viewable and verifiable so they can't really do anything
against that I can make this product in any other country the world is a simple board
to make so like you know if they came after us it would actually be quite amazing because
you know again they're just revealing their hand and we would know exactly the extent
they could go about it all this this physical attacks are often very targeted because they're
extremely costly and they have high failure rate right so it's very hard to do something
that is against like everybody right I mean the them banning people from downloading free
movies on torrent failed miserably the way that that diminished was by by the market
meeting the demand which was to lower the cost and find different business models right
so I think essentially what we're gonna see is gonna be very similar to the movie or music
industry where governments are gonna have to accept that they no longer have the monopoly
on on money and and and they're gonna have to compete and it should be added that it's
very easy to hide an open down because of those rounded corners but I think I think
we're gonna see this crackdown happen if they try it is going to be again at those centralized
choke points with companies like us with the regulated exchanges and they might try to
make it so that we're not allowed as a regulated entity to send bitcoins to a wallet that is
not verifiably linked to a regulated custodian or another regulated exchange so that's something
that we're definitely gonna fight pretty hard if they try to put that in here in Canada
but I think that's like that's the only even remotely realistic way that they can go about
banning self-custody well look at the Swiss solution right so in Switzerland they have
this thing where if you wanna if you wanna withdraw your funds from an exchange a regulated
exchange you need to sign you either have to go to an to a custodial wallet or you have
to prove that you own the key but but that's idiotic because you can prove that you own
the key and then move the friends right after like 10 over times and and then you had a
both accident like these things are so ineffective and the cost of them to society like in actual
dollars are you know they're absurd.
The question is what does it actually mean to ban self-custody at the very lowest level
what that would be saying is you are not allowed to have a large random number in your possession
and we we know just due to the the nature of information and information wanting to
be free and the the internet and all these other communications channels that make it
impossible to truly stop the flow of information is that it's just a fool's errand and and
I think basically to go back to what Dave said earlier is that sure they can implement
those mandates and they can go to the the choke points of the regulated institutions
and say you know you have to abide by that but what is that really gonna do it's just
gonna cause a split it's gonna result in those regulated institutions being their own walled
gardens and meanwhile the rest of the world goes on as a quote-unquote black market which
is of course just more government propaganda for free market Jameson touched on the point
exactly you can ban Bitcoin but I don't have physical possession of bitcoins right my bitcoins
live on chain and as he said I I have some random numbers that I control that allows
me to sign a message to move the ownership of those coins right so like when you talk
about bans and we got a little bit into this earlier with semantics and you were saying
banning Bitcoin are you actually banning the holding of private keys where the ownership
of Bitcoin and this gets into a really tricky area because to my knowledge if you ever have
a search and seizure or warrant you know served against you it needs to explicitly define
the physical items that that team is there to look for so are they coming to seize numbers
is that what we're talking about here when we're talking about these types of local enforcement
you know personally I think they would just use similar like common law that we have for
beneficiary right that's how corporations work so you know they'll just say you're the
beneficiary of that of that Bitcoin on on the chain right so you have signing authority over
that on the chain and then we have already like plenty of case law on that but but that's still
like you know are you gonna ban you know people from having Sony authority on something like
it becomes very complicated because you know it's still your property it's you know and now it's
free speech because it's money so it's gonna they they're on an uphill battle they can't win
and yeah it gets into the realm of banning thoughts
good point um so I have one more question before I open up to Q&A I'll give people some time to
request but um so something that we talked about in the Bitcoin community is the prospect of the
boating accident theoretically if fed or investigator knocks on your door and you say I
lost my Bitcoin in a boating accident um how does that actually play out
yeah I think that depends if they know if you have it prior or not um when someone's knocking on
your door you know it's already kind of worst case situation where you don't know what they know what
information you put out there whether or not they're asking you leading questions or false
questions to get you to either admit or deny something based on their goal so that's a tricky
one because if they're coming for you they probably already know information or have
justification to do it and if you're lying or trying to deceive people I think then you're
putting yourself in in deeper trouble depending on how you react to that so I would think that
preventing that situation to begin with and not making yourself a target is probably better advice
than how do I how do I actually deal with that situation when it transpires because I don't
actually have good advice it's going to be very much situational dependent you know they do have
a lot of law and orders to produce right and and in a way if they suspect or the judge agrees that
they suspect that you have something that they want to know or have and and the court is in agreement
with the the law they they would they would just hold in contempt right so your their electric rock
for quite a while before the electric goes so you know I you know as funny as you know this is a good
meme it's not it's probably not a very good uh strategy yeah I mean first of all remember it's
it's not possible to prove a negative right it's you can't prove that you lost your coins though
here's an interesting possibility I haven't really heard people think of of this situation but
I wonder like if you really wanted to make sure that your coins can't be seized the only way like
100 full proof way I'm aware of doing that is to either burn the funds you know send them to a burn
address so then literally no one in the world can ever access them or to do a a time lock on them
you know you could put a 10 20 30 year time lock on it and then you could even you know
cryptographically prove to the government that your your your funds are quote unquote frozen
and there's nothing that that any government authority can do about that but otherwise it's
very tricky I would say at least in the United States the the best legal advice when it comes to
you're talking to law enforcement is don't any anything that is said to law enforcement should
happen through an attorney because they have a much better idea of what they're doing and what
you potentially expose yourself to whenever you say anything otherwise if you do say something
like I lost all my bitcoin then you're putting yourself in a very tenuous situation especially
if at any point those coins touched any KYC services or could otherwise be traced to you
because if you ever want to spend them again in the future there's a high likelihood that that
activity is going to raise some red flags yeah I think it's going to come down to the same thing
again where they'll probably end up regulating that at the exchange level and if somebody is
you know deemed to have had a bullying accident and they they don't feel like going with a wrench
attack then they will probably put surveillance on you at the exchange level and say these exchanges
must freeze whatever friends come in up to a certain level just like we saw with the truckers
thank you so um at that point we'll move to Q&A and I'll just quickly reset the room
for those that joined after we started this is a theoretical discussion we're not advocating that
anybody go break any laws we're just talking theory here Justin I added you to the to the stage do
you have a question for the panel yeah yeah thanks for having me um I'm a bit of a bitcoin
pleb so um my understanding I'm still learning about bitcoin and everything but um I'm actually
going to be speaking to uh my parliament in just over half an hour and I have five minutes to really
you know give a bitcoin uh pitch and but really the main point was to protest this
um the central bank digital currencies that we're going to be testing soon in the country
so yeah I was just wondering if um yeah what would your five minute pitch be to
kind of deter a country from using central bank digital currencies and adopting bitcoin
I would try to enlighten them that this is a technology that is sound insecure and has been
going strong well over for 13 years now whereas CBDCs are very much new and untested and theoretical
and there's a lot of back and forth and pros and cons to them um I would let them know that you
know a lot of uh governmental programs while you do you know you need to be a respectful position
when you're talking to them obviously with this but while they uh they do implement these things
they're not always implemented correctly and if you look at the private sector and industry a lot
of times they do things better right so why would we want to create a new technology when we already
got one out there that is working is in the people's hands and is decentralized and secure
give them the example of compost serve versus the internet there's very little incentive to create
a network of just one node right the query exists is a network they'll capture a lot more value
because they'll be early and you know if they try to make their own thing it's just going to be
another version of their current uh state money that will likely go down the drain anyways
yeah and I think the the first point I would make would be that as a payment network
bitcoin is inevitable it's very difficult as we've been discussing the sensor and
all but impossible to stop when it comes to payments and that by embracing it at that very
surface level for payments um there's actually a possibility for the country to bring in investment
and innovation like we're seeing in El Salvador right now so that's like the toes in the water
but I think the real um our like eventual outcome for any nation state is to start moving away from
this unlimited money printing term and start separating financial policy from monetary policy
and whichever country starts doing that starts like meaningfully accumulating bitcoin to use as
their national currency eventually is probably going to be the richest country in the world
yeah I think uh approaching it from a first mover advantage standpoint is important because
the any given country that has its own central bank and its own currency it's going to be
to be highly incentivized to keep doing that and you know continue to have as much control over as
many different levers as possible and so it's it may seem stupid to give up a lot of those points
of control in order to adopt this new technology but I would think it's new technology but I would
think of it as instead um you're being one of the the first early adopters of what will eventually
become the digital gold standard and will be greater than any one country it will be the
global standard that works because no single nation state can manipulate it
it also has been one of the technical benefits right so what we're looking at is very similar
to when we were all walking around with nokia phones in our pockets and we had the t9 sms
text everybody and within the span of a decade due to the uh entrepreneurship and ingenuity of
some of the silicon valley uh texts that were out there we're all walking around with smartphones
now which kind of blew our world apart and it's hard to think about the pre-smartphone world when
we were all walking around how we communicated how we got access to our work email how we did
the things that we needed to do on a daily basis so what you should do is you should explain to
them that we are at that precipice right now where we can make a choice you know do we want
to keep nokias in our pocket or do we want to advance and get into the smartphone world
and i think if you look at that bitcoin is the smartphone of money right why would you why would
you shy away from that thank you for your question and good luck with your talk with parliament
um thanks for that everyone that was great um so this next person i add to the stage i love this
handle noodle nakamoto do you have a question for the panel yeah um cheers thank you um ron said
that if possible um don't use centralized exchanges to acquire bitcoin etc um but for those of us that
did and i'd imagine there's you know a fair few is mixing the only option to get privacy back and
it's kind of a two-part that's kind of part one part two is sort of you know reflecting on what
just happened with um wasabi in that kind of floor that was discovered with people mixing i think you
know previous utxos with new utxos etc um after that happened how much confidence you guys have
with you know things like whirlpool from samurai um and the mixing facility that's in sparrow wallet
for instance um may i just be quick um it's a bit controversial maybe um so i think people need to
be careful with uh privacy larping um you know a lot of these tools are actually very good if you
if you do it well uh i think many if not most of the average users will likely screw themselves
if you know trying to use these tools and you also have to be careful with your local laws
regarding mixing and things like that because you could essentially be saying that you're doing
something wrong right i think they're fantastic like joint market is fantastic there's a lot of
good tools out there but i think people need to be need to understand more before they sort of
jump in and put their life savings into something that could cause them harm yeah 100 um and
you know straight up i'll be honest i wouldn't know how to use some of those services i've read
up on them it's just that from a privacy standpoint um if you've got coins that you've already got from
an exchange and you just want you know you're not a criminal you you just want privacy um you know
what's the best way to go about it if you know if you just want to kind of give yourself a
a clean record almost as if you'd mined the coins yourself i think the separation is probably the
best thing in your case because you've already acquired the coins they've already gone through
an exchange there's already probably kyc information tied to them that's not the worst
thing in the world if you're not a criminal and you're not trying to scam people and you're not
doing money laundering right if you're just transacting with it or buying it to hold or
speculate or you love the technology and just want to contribute to it that's great when you
start to introduce mixing with that though it gets to be a problem because mixing is not just the one
and done type of function or software that you run once and then you're in the clear you have to do
a lot of upkeep continually where you're making sure that you're keeping your mixed outputs and
inputs and things like that separate from other ones and that you're continuing to not uh to mix
and match any of those things and it's a lot of work so what i would say is if you're the type
of person where you're not a criminal you're not worried about that you probably don't have too much
to worry but you do have the privacy aspect still and i think with more protocol improvements and
signature aggregations and all cool new technology enhancements you will get more of that privacy
over time but the problem you're going to encounter if you go to mix it and you don't do it correctly
is they're going to be able to remix it and find your identity anyway in the case that you're
being targeted and then the second thing is if you do mix them and then you try to transact with
those coins they may get flagged right even if you're using them for legal purposes because it's
a few hops away from the mixer or it's been identified as part of different coin drawing
processes that are out there things like that you could be unintentionally making your life
harder right so i think again uh sitting tight and just waiting if you have the coins there's
things you may be able to do in the future to help kind of add some more of the privacy benefits
back to it that that that's a really interesting point and i suppose taking the other side of the
kind of coin if you will um that means any bitcoin user if i've understood you correctly
could also could also be exposed to that kind of overreach if they've interacted with a mixed coin
you know that that they've never know they just didn't know about is that correct go ahead bradley
yeah like i think it's possible um that would be a bit of a stretch based on the current technical
and knowledge base that we're seeing from governments right now um but there might be
some requirements at some point um i i would take the position that your uh your kyz coins that you
have are probably going to be fine and uh that said it's not a bad idea to get some non-kyz coins
to get some non-kyz coins as a hedge to that idea and uh it's also one of those things where like
in the worst case scenario if like it's what we're describing here in the very unlikely scenario
where you've got people kicking down doors looking for uh those are supposed to have bitcoins um
you know you probably want to have something to give them in that case uh and so having those
non-kyz coins would be kind of like a hedge on top of your kyz coins um and you know another
interesting aspect of this is uh you know mixing is just one sort of like thing there is also a
million non-kyz sort of like you know digital contracts out there that people will sort of
make legitimate investments in and then you know withdraw legitimately and you know like it's no
longer the original coins right it's the same as sending to an exchange and taking it out so
you know it's one of those things that like they can write it into law but like good luck enforcing
it other people are going to tell you do like throw it on the lightning network or send it
into manero into a manero black hole privacy coin black hole and then bring it back out
but even some of those types of things the tooling and when you do that stuff it goes on chain
right so even if the tooling doesn't necessarily exist today or isn't as optimized as it is today
you know that doesn't mean in two years they're not going to be able to trace things more
efficiently than they can today with some of the chain analysis um software that's out there
um sergio do you have a question for the panel uh yeah thanks for bringing me up uh i was just
going to go back to what dave said earlier about just kind of i know diversifying is kind of a
stupid word to use i mean it's a little bit old for investors but it probably is a good idea to
split up uh your coins to consider different you know different avenues to put them in with
kyc and no kyc so i'm you know i've been mining since the summer and that's kind of a no kyc way
to do it of course you got to have some capital to get maybe get started with that um compass
offers a service i don't know if anybody would like to do that or if they have capital to do it
but it's a good way to get kind of quasi uh no kyc coins um so i'm doing that but i'm also a casa
customer and i don't know if i don't know if this is a question i think someone brought it up the
other day in either as a twitter space maybe as a podcast but what do you guys do um with your node
what do you guys do with the coins when i send it into my my casa wallet i have a two or three
multi sig so i don't know if you guys mix the coins when you put it in there or what do you
guys actually do well uh we do get asked fairly regularly you know if if casa is going to implement
any sort of coin join or mixing or whatever and uh short version is it's actually kind of antithetical
to the security model that we offer like if you want to be doing coin mixing that's a very
interactive process so you have to have those coins on a hot wallet that can be regularly signing
these large coin joint transactions so it's not something that we've even really looked into
implementing because you know it's automatically putting your coins into a lower security model
than we uh try to offer by default okay of course it's technically possible for us to do lower
security model than we uh try to offer by default okay of course it's technically possible for us
to do um and then even even past that there would be further questions of like exactly
which mixing protocol would we use and what would the coins be mixed with and what are the you know
potential legal ramifications around all of that so yeah it's it's fairly i would say fairly low
on the priority list for for us to implement ourselves what i normally recommend people do
is that i i don't think it really makes a ton of sense to be constantly mixing your coins um
it may make sense to to mix them you know before you deposit them into casa i don't really think
so either really the only time that i think it makes the most sense to to mix your coins is when
you are about to make a payment on shane if if you want to be able to make a payment and do it in such
a way that the person can't just plug that transaction into a block explorer all the way
back a few hops and basically see your entire wallet i think when doing coin join makes the
most sense for the average person yeah that makes a lot of sense okay and then i guess one other
thing i is just like a comment you know i've been been a cost customer for a little over a year now
um but like i said i wanted to diversify so i started doing the mining but there there are times
when you know i'm looking at price and if i see a you know a trigger where it's like a 20 dip or
even 15 or 10 dip i'll go buy coins and i'll i'll send it straight over to my sparrow wallet
and i don't know if anybody has played around with the sparrow wallet but they now have a mixing tool
in there for coin join and it's kind of nice because you can you can coin join but then you
can have it mix coin join and then directly put into another wallet that you create on a sparrow
so there is there's a way to kind of diversify the way that you're mixing it there so you're not
you know you're not mixing and then it's stuck there and then you got to send it again and then
well you just mix them and now you're sending it so now they can backtrace that so there's kind
of a cool way for you to mix it and then automatically send it to like a cold card
or a treasure or something like that thanks for the suggestion um salamante i asked added you to
the stage do you have a question for the panel yeah thanks for the opportunity so i guess my
question in the event of there's a ban um i'm trying to assess kind of the risk to the collaborative
custody model right so i'm also a customer of kasa so i can see a situation kind of like what's
happening and kind of like let's say things get so bad here in the us wouldn't it be possible for
them to just say the kasa hey we're gonna kill your mobile apps no one all kasa customers all
of a sudden they're not going to be able to use their kasa app and then they will basically
prevent kasa from signing any transaction so all of all of this collaborative custody customers will
will be forced to kind of use the kind of recovery method right we're using electrum and doing it on
their own um so do you see that as a risk where the government can say that kasa for example you
cannot sign any transactions for your customers and then shut down your app would that be a
possibility i mean it's it's always technically a possibility and it's something that you should
consider as an edge case and this is why we've designed it so that the app and our servers are
not a single point of failure i think it's a pretty big edge case uh like if canada came to us and
told us to shut everything down uh we would definitely discuss that with legal counsel
before deciding how to respond like i'm not even sure if they would have the legal authority to
put that sort of pressure on us um but yeah so could an authority compel just assume it's united
state's government since that's where we're based could we be compelled you know not to sign
transactions uh i mean i would just assume that kasa as a company gets completely nuked you know
that is the worst case scenario whether it happens due to a government action or due to some other
weird environmental edge case doesn't really matter and that's when it's important for you
to be able to follow that sovereign recovery process and i really encourage all of our customers
to do it now do it ahead of time make sure that you're comfortable with with being able to do it
even though you will probably never have to it's it's just like practicing any other sort of
emergency drill um you want to make sure that you are comfortable with the fact that you have the
ability to follow those instructions so yeah i mean it's a worst case scenario and but it's
still one that we want to not end up causing catastrophic loss to our customers if it does
happen yeah that makes sense and i obviously that's not going to happen through like law
passed through congress right it's going to be something where you know declared emergency and
then you know abusing the laws right that's kind of the situation that i'm potentially
anticipating because it happened in canada right i never thought it would happen in canada and it
did so that's why i'm so the last question i have um for i know we talk a lot about kyc versus non
kyc coins um wouldn't we want to be uh you know increasing like because the more we use as
bitcoiners right use these tools to whirlpool or coin join wouldn't that kind of force the
government to say yes that's dirty money versus us bitcoiners cooperating doing it the right way in
kyc paying our taxes and then incorporating that as part of the ecosystem um just when i get your
thoughts i you know like i see it being promoted a lot which is a good thing but i think we still
you know as responsible bitcoiners we should be still paying taxes um that way you know because
if the majority is not paying taxes and using these tools to um not pay taxes then then then
we're asking basically uh the government in congress to kind of attack us right so why don't
you get your thoughts on that i think there's a couple different issues at play here uh one
of them is the just fungibility of bitcoin in general and the unfortunate aspect of the fact
that very few people actually use mixers means that if you are using these privacy enhancing tools
as of now it actually makes you a bigger suspect even if you're not doing anything illegal
uh it will you know if if anything comes up um with a a chain analysis company or or any sort
of regulated exchange that's looking at the the history of your funds within several hops then
the fact that your funds have gone through privacy enhancing tools actually increases your risk score
and makes it more likely that the regulated institutions will decide not to do business
with you um you know a in in an optimal world we would all be using coin join and in various
privacy enhancing tools and it would be so pervasive that it would just not be tenable
for any of these institutions to refuse to do business with us because they would be
basically cutting off their own foot um unfortunately i don't see us getting to
that point anytime soon on the other hand from a sort of taxation perspective i think that's less
of an issue of um of using privacy enhancing tools i think that probably comes down more to
money laundering than taxation and i suspect that the money launderers who you know they're
basically trying to clean the proceeds from other criminal activities just so that they can spend
them i doubt that they're going to be paying taxes on them either way but regardless like when it
comes to taxes and you're paying your your capital gains and whatnot i i don't really think that on
chain or or really any technical privacy considerations or any like aml or non-kyc stuff
even really matters of when it comes to the taxation stuff because what's ultimately going
to happen is if you want to realize uh a non-negligible amount of gains that you've
gotten from investing in these systems you're going to be buying property you know you're going
to be increasing your lifestyle and it's those things that end up um getting attention from the
tax authorities you know if they see you acquiring property and there's a mismatch between what you
have uh reported and your your basically level of of lifestyle um there's really nothing that any
on chain or technical privacy is going to do to help you when it comes down to that no thank you
very much that was quite helpful thanks for the opportunity you guys thank you and um
infinity long i added you to the stage if you have a question for the panel and this will be our last
question for the day thank you so much for joining us up infinitely long take it away
hey guys thanks for having me so um i'm kind of new to the space and you guys keep mentioning kyc
um what do you guys think are like the best non-kyc methods to acquire bitcoin
this question comes up a lot i think in a lot of the spaces we've done because it's
more topical now some of the ones we've mentioned here like if you run your own
miner and you're mining your own bitcoin you don't need to report that to anybody right you
didn't need to put an id on file to accrue that so that's one way you can do that there's some
interesting games that are actually being built on the lighting network and i don't suggest that for
like trying to get any significant amount of value it's more it came to like viewing ads on can do
that there's some interesting games that are actually being built on the lighting network
and i don't suggest that for like trying to get any significant amount of value it's more it came
came to like viewing ads on the internet to get a couple cents
here and there. But you can pull a couple hundred satoshis for
free with various games and mobile apps. And even some of
the the savings apps, the full guard and some of the other
various ones that are out there, lolly, you can spin for sats or
you can get bonus sats per day. So if you're the type of person
where you do that for five minutes every morning as part of
your routine, you can start to build up a little tiny stack
and it's not going to be anything significant, but you
are getting KYC free Bitcoin that could be worth a little bit
more in the next decade or so. So you want to consider those
types of things. The other thing I saw people as labor, right? If
you have a skill set, and you want to do a job for somebody,
if you're a security professional, you do a
penetration test. I've done those for Bitcoin before as a
payment, right? And while I was doing it through my business and
legally and declared it on taxes, depending on where your
jurisdiction is, or who you are, there may be different laws or
reporting reporting requirements for exchange for payment for
skills and labor. So I would look into those types of things
to see what those limits are, because there are ways that you
can act within the system and do it. The last one people are
going to recommend is local bitcoins. And I think that that
has changed over the past couple of years and is not as a viable
method. But if you start attending Bitcoin groups,
meetups, things like that, you will start to hear of or
discover opportunities to make purchases that may not have to
go through a KYC process. Any business in most developed world
can charge Bitcoin for their services and products, like
that's what we do. So, you know, just earn Bitcoin by selling
what you have, like, it doesn't take much to add the plugin to
your shopping carts to start accepting Bitcoin for your
services.

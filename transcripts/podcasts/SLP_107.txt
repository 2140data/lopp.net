Hi and welcome to the Stefan Levera podcast focused on Bitcoin and Austrian economics.
Today for episode 107, we are talking with Jeremy Welch and Jameson Lopp of CASA.
But first, let me introduce the sponsors of the podcast.
Check out Kraken, one of the world's leading Bitcoin exchanges.
I'm really impressed with the way they have operated consistently with a strong focus
on security over the years.
They have acted ethically in the space as well under Jesse Powell's leadership.
They're one of the longest standing Bitcoin exchanges and they consistently read the best.
They've got high trading volume and low fees with no minimum or hidden fees.
Kraken also have 24x7 support and on the institutional and solution side, they are providing best
in class accounting, reconciliation and reporting services for cryptocurrency hedge funds, asset
managers and fund administrators.
Kraken have an OTC desk for those higher touch large block trades.
They offer 5 fiat currencies and also offer margin and futures trades.
To learn more and sign up, go to the Kraken link in the show notes.
Next up is Unchain Capital.
They're doing Bitcoin financial services and their two main products are a two of three
keys multi-signature vault and a Bitcoin collateralized loan.
So with the vault, remember it's difficult to use multi-signature right now, but Unchain
Capital have a very easy solution and you can use Trezor or Ledger and you're still
maintaining control with your two keys and you can distribute those keys to improve your
security a little bit.
And we'll also be talking with Dhruv Bansal from Unchained Capital on the podcast shortly
so keep an eye out for that episode.
Remember Unchain Capital also offer Bitcoin collateralized loans so you can get USD liquidity
without selling your Bitcoins and incurring that capital gains event, which might be better
for you from a tax point of view.
So they store that under a dedicated multi-sig address under collaborative custody.
So if you want to learn more and sign up, go to the Unchain Capital link in the show
notes.
So for this episode today, we are carrying on with the Bitcoin custody series and this
episode was actually recorded together in person at Riga just before the Baltic Honey
Badger Conference the first day.
So we're speaking with Jeremy Welch, the CEO of CASA, and Jameson Lopp, the CTO of
CASA.
They've both been on the show previously.
Jeremy was on SLP 26 and Jameson was on SLP 43.
So keep an eye out for this conversation where we're talking about some of the different
security decisions made from CASA's perspective and how they have designed their different
services and how they think about security, which they have recently released in the CASA
Wealth Security Protocol document.
Here is the interview.
Jeremy and Jameson, welcome back to the show.
It's fun.
How are you, man?
Good.
So we are recording here in Riga just before the Baltic Honey Badger 2019.
So yeah, look, guys, I wanted to get you guys back on and talk about the CASA Security or
CASA Wealth Protocol, rather, and also just what's going on with CASA these days.
So maybe Jeremy, you just want to give a quick overview on where the company is at and what's
going on.
Sure, sure, sure.
So just this past week, or about a week ago, we released this CASA Wealth Security Protocol.
We've had some other updates around the multisig side and also around SATS app and around some
updates to the node.
But one of the big things we've done the last few weeks is release this document that really
expands through the full security model, the features that we chose.
We actually chose to go ahead and lose all of the features that we didn't choose to use
to, because there are specific reasons why we did those.
And this should just help.
There's a lot that we usually walk our clients through.
Anyone that comes to us, most of our clients actually know all the things that are in the
stock already.
But for the majority of the population, majority of the Bitcoin community, they're not aware
of this.
So we thought that putting in a document form, making it really easy to access, and then
also update.
And as we learn, as we work with customers, we'll update this from year to year.
But it makes it really easy to have a rule set to really gauge against.
Yeah, I mean, this is part of what I think is the real value add of CASA as a system
where we've focused a lot on both the technical and the user interface design such that a
user could just come into CASA and start using it and basically have this huge benefit of
the wealth of knowledge of like 50 pages of technical decisions that have been made around
the security model.
But of course, we have people who are securing a large amount of wealth within our system.
And in many cases, they want to then further dig down into actually understanding why the
system is designed the way that it is.
And this, like Jeremy said, basically explains those decisions that we've already had to
describe to a lot of our customers over the past couple of years.
Fantastic.
Yeah.
And I've had a chance to read through the document.
I thought it was really nicely written.
In the document, you speak through the three alternatives, right?
So you've got kind of do it yourself, custodial storage, and then other commercial sovereign
storage systems.
And another thing that struck out to me is also just the comparison with Glacier Protocol.
So my previous interview was with Diogo Monaco, the maintainer of Glacier Protocol.
And it strikes me like as I was reading the document, the CASA document, it's essentially
talking about how there are certain trade-offs that we make using Glacier Protocol.
I think one of the key ones is the difficulty of usability and the difficulty of setting
up.
And I think that's one thing that I view CASA is doing is you guys are really helping with
the usability of high security option.
Do you want to discuss about that?
Sure.
So everything we built around the CASA wealth security protocol is in direct response to
and kind of an extension of learnings from Glacier Protocol.
So Jacob Lyles, who created the Glacier Protocol, is on the team, helped us write this document,
helped us really pull a lot of the resources together whenever we built this.
But we actually use Glacier Protocol as a kind of basis to start working from.
And a lot of companies have done this in the past, a lot of even exchange companies use
Glacier Protocol early on as foundations for their cold storage.
And we just saw that it's rock soft, but it's very hard to implement and execute and set
up where we wanted something that usability, if we go through kind of our threats and we
kind of identified these 13 core threats, one of them is just working from what we call
a child or pet attack or these kind of usability issues of needing to be kind of idiot proof
in a sense.
And Glacier Protocol is just really extensive.
And so from that perspective, it will always say that we actually are, I don't think we've
announced that publicly yet, that we are kind of co-maintaining with Diogo and those guys
with Glacier Protocol.
But we kind of did the learning from there and then we've tried to extend it and specifically
in the direction of where the Anchorage guys and they built a phenomenal product company
and they're really focused on the enterprise side, we're kind of extending in the side
of the consumer and the side of the individual small teams for kind of maximum security.
And we talk wealth security instead of just Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the core focus
and that's what we're focused on, but it really is around Bitcoin as data and these threats
are going to be true of any type of data going forward and personal wealth.
I think that you could potentially describe CASA as seeking to find the optimal practical
security solution.
When it comes to security, if you're really trying to go for fully trustless, fully minimizing
the risk of anything going wrong, then you take it to the extreme, you basically can
get to the point of, well, you basically need to be writing your own software or at least
auditing all the software you're using and then even the more extreme is, well, on the
hardware side, you basically need to be fabricating your own hardware to make sure that nobody
has tampered with that because we're at the level of complexity these days with the hardware
that nobody really knows everything that's going on.
And so the question is, where do you draw the line of, well, I'm going to assume that
everything below this level is working and can be trusted.
And for us, we're raising the line a lot higher and saying, well, we're going to assume that
if we spread out your key generation and management across multiple different providers, then
you're lowering the risk that you don't really need to worry about things like supply chain
attacks or low-level hardware issues.
Yeah.
And to me, even reading the wealth protocol, wealth security protocol document, it came
clear to me there was this concept of defense in depth, right?
It's saying, how do you set up your security in such a way that any individual failure will
not compromise you totally, that you can afford one failure or before you lose your wealth?
You need to have a more flexible system because Bitcoin and the sovereignty that it gives
to you is also highly inflexible and unforgiving when it comes to mistakes.
And that's why it seems like the bigger risk of loss in these systems is actually due to
ignorance and user mistakes as opposed to actual attack and theft.
Right.
Yeah.
So there's that idea that you're more likely to screw yourself out of your own coins if
you're trying to do multi-sig and you make a mistake with it.
I think even Andrew Chao on the previous episode mentioned that he had difficulties trying
to get multi-signature with multi-hardware while it's working.
And he is himself a quite competent technical developer.
So if it's hard for him, it's going to be hard for anyone, right?
So there's definitely some components around that.
Let's talk a bit about some of the design principles from the document.
So you've got here minimal knowledge.
Yeah.
And there's a lot around minimizing data on CASA.
It's both for privacy reasons, but also for can't-be-evil reasons, right?
That's one of our core company principles.
But we have a set of system design principles.
And we're touching on a few things from the document.
Anybody can go download this.
You just Google CASA Wealth Security Protocol, or I think it's keys.casa.forge.wealth-security-protocol,
I think.
Yeah.
You can check this out and follow along.
But there's a lot more here.
But kind of the high level there is that Elena has this term, don't collect what you can't
protect.
And for most companies, even just from the side of people exploiting it for their own
purposes, this can't-be-evil principle is what we're talking about there.
You need to minimize data.
So minimal knowledge just really means that we're going to have minimal knowledge overall
of data, period.
And usability as security is another one, just thinking about export support.
It's not just about even like the software.
It is about the integrations of the data, but it's also about working with humans and
humans being part of that system, too, and having experts.
Sovereignty as a principle, incentive alignment, again, that kind of aligns with can't-be-evil.
If we can't even attack you or an internal employee can't even attack you, then that
just changes the logic tremendously.
If the data's not even there, it changes the logic tremendously, versus if a kind of internal
employee is going to have to be tested regularly, whether they want to exploit data.
So keeping the system design principles and then looking at the total number of threats,
and we had about 13 total threats that we consider, is how we then chose the kind of
selected features.
Yeah.
And there's also the principle of usability as security.
So did you want to touch on that around how in making it more usable, you actually are
making people more secure?
So quick example.
I think it's probably fair to say a lot of people have looked at Glacier, but have not
executed Glacier, because it takes a certain level of patience, diligence to execute.
And I think that is a key point from CASA the way.
Well, and basically every step that you have to take is a potential mistake.
So the simpler you can make it, the more...
When I think of usability, I think of when we're building actual software interfaces
that humans are using, you are creating a series of paths that a user can go through.
And at CASA, we're trying to lead it to paths that include the best practices, that include
a lot of these secure principles, so that what you're really doing is you are trying
to throw away as many foot guns as possible within the infinite number of possible decisions
that a user could make when they're setting up and executing their own storage.
So many of these paths make it possible for you to screw up in a catastrophic way.
And we're basically just trying to create guardrails that prevent the user from even
going off on others' paths in the first place.
Well, still maintaining the sovereignty.
That was an important point.
And that's why this kind of full system design principles, you have to keep them in balance.
And it really does have to be balanced, because there are certain things you can do to improve
your ability, but that take away control from the end user.
Going fully centralized, it's way more usable.
Let's be frank, it's just Coinbase and just throwing someone a regular login is way more
usable on the surface, but it immediately takes away sovereignty, immediately takes
away control.
It immediately creates a can't be evil situation to where someone could take coins.
And so doing that balance of making sure it's usable while at the absolute extreme that
we can while also maintaining that sovereignty is really important while optimizing data.
And we've even gone as far even from the legal structure of the company.
We have this open data policy, our privacy policy, we kind of wrote a totally new type
of privacy policy.
And that's open source.
Other companies can copy that.
We're trying to go through kind of every step of the way to build up this stack in terms
of the design of the overall system and the incentives even for the internal employees
to again, address these 13 threats.
Let's talk a little bit about some of the, I guess, what are some of the big threats
in your mind?
What were some of the ones that are most obvious for the user?
So I guess just off the list here, there's a few SIM hijacking, that's a big one lately.
Supply chain attack, that's something where a lot of people are concerned about that and
trying to have different hardware wallets and different software that they're working
with, data credential loss, or even being attacked on the platform that you're using.
Did you have any that you wanted to kind of highlight?
Well I mean, I think that of the ones that are listed, the most common one is just simple
data loss.
And so that's why we believe having a geographically distributed set of hardware devices that are
easy for the user to visualize and think about how are these actually distributed, that gives
you a level of redundancy and robustness that is going to exceed 99% of other people who
are just keeping all their keys in one place.
And I suppose let's just for, I think most listeners might have heard the earlier episodes,
but just in case they haven't, the basic overview, you've got the silver and gold, which is the
two of three basic multi-sig, and my understanding there is they have one hardware wallet, and
they've got one key on their phone, and then one key is the CASA recovery key in that model.
And then taking it up a notch to the platinum and diamond, and that is the $1,800 level
and the $5,000 level, that is a three of five setup.
We have three hardware wallets in that model.
There is one key held on the user's mobile phone, and the fifth key is held by, it's
the CASA recovery key.
So I guess let's just talk to maybe the two of three model.
I think one concern I've heard from Bitcoiners is that, oh, hang on, does CASA have two of
my three keys, two of the three keys?
How can I be sure that I hold two of three?
Well, you can ensure that you hold two of three.
We also have export functionality on the mobile key.
I suppose, however, it's impossible to prove that CASA doesn't have the mobile key.
That is one thing that you'd have to quote, unquote, trust us on, and so this is another
good reason of why there are trade-offs here.
We do intend to add ability to have two different hardware devices, so you could then have a
greater assurance that you have two of the keys, and there's no way CASA could have two
of the three.
But right now, that assurance is best provided by the three of five model.
We kind of rolled this out intentionally from the three of five, where we were able to build
up a user base and work directly with clients.
We have direct client relationships.
It is kind of like a private banking relationship.
We learn a lot from client preferences.
We've done a tremendous amount of testing before we rolled it out to people publicly,
but then we also learned a ton from even just the first several months, and we're now, over
a year of being public, I guess it's almost like 1.5 years of being public, and all of
that wealth of knowledge, we've kind of scaled up.
We always intended to scale, and we actually have a single key, a mobile key, as well.
Again, it's a single key.
It's on the phone.
That's actually used, and it's the same key that's shared with our Sats app.
So if you want, Sats app is just really fast spending, and Keymaster is the kind of full
multi-sig.
But even the way we rolled that out is we, again, started with the three of five most
premium multi-sig, and then we slowly rolled out.
We had two of three, the single key, slowly rolled those out.
We rolled out the two of three specifically to goal customers first to make sure that
that was usable.
We also, we mentioned before the multi-location, multi-device, multi-sig model.
The reason around that, again, is in terms of these 13 threats, that model is what mitigates
those threats the best.
There's a weird trade-off where with the mobile device, if you're going to use a mobile device,
from the principle of the usability side, you actually want to maximize usage as soon
as you decide to even use it because of the fact that you can also maximize usability.
Now that mobile device, as a single device, is your phone is potentially connected to
the internet.
We do have customers that choose to keep that off at all times, never really connect to
the internet, and that effectively does act similarly to a hardware wallet.
But it's effectively just a really fancy hardware wallet.
But for most people, they keep it as a regular key.
When people have asked us about that question too, what that comes down to is that it's
also true that Apple or Google and most, it's either a Google phone or an Apple phone that
people are using, they could even try to exploit that key.
And as soon as you put that key on the platform, you want to maximize the features that are
available there.
So we've done that now on the phone.
And for the two of three, it's specifically designed, it's not designed to hold millions
of dollars.
It is designed to hold somewhere between say $1,000 and around $100,000, sometimes less.
We do have people that put even a little less than $100,000 on the three of five, right?
So we have, there's a range of what people are comfortable with, but it is designed to
be an entry-level version of just getting started with Multi-Sig.
That's why we decided, hey, we will use the mobile key and then one hardware wallet.
And for most people that started using this, they'd never used Multi-Sig before.
So it was already a learning experience.
We had a lot of people that upgraded immediately after and they were like, oh yeah, I get it
now, why there need to be multiple keys.
We will be rolling out a version that does have the two hardware wallets, but we wanted
heavy testing around just that single version first before we do that.
But these are great questions and the community is always phenomenal about asking and figuring
out these kind of nooks and crannies of questions.
And again, that's why we released this document, is that there's a lot more even beyond some
of these questions that customers are asking.
And so we just want to kind of constantly put these forward and bring these for ourselves
and have that level of transparency.
And so even as we're adding more features, we expect to get a lot more of these questions.
Yeah, sure.
And I think it might be good just for the listeners who are not familiar, just to understand
what is the way the mechanism works.
So they might be thinking, oh, do I need to bring all three keys into one place at one
time, but actually, it's more like you individually do the signatures, do you want to talk through
the process?
Yeah.
So when you're creating a transaction with the Keymaster app, actually, it's like any
other transaction, you can scan a QR code, you can manually input data, but basically,
you set those initial details of the amount and the output destination, and then you'll
apply your initial signature there with the key that's on the device and most likely using
either your biometric or face ID or pin input to basically unlock the mobile device so that
you can access the key which we keep secured via the secure hardware elements that are
on the phone.
And so then what you have is a partially signed transaction.
It's not valid for broadcasting on the Bitcoin network.
You then have to go figure out what other devices do I want to use to add a sufficient
number of signatures that it becomes valid.
And essentially, you just tap within the app on the device you want to use and you say,
hey, I want to add another signature from here, will then generate a short-lived unique
link that you can use to essentially go find that device wherever it is, plug it into a
laptop, click on the link, add the signature, and then continue that process until everything
is done.
And of course, it can get more complicated if you've lost devices and need to have help
from CASA that enters into a different logical recovery process.
But under normal circumstances, you're basically just going to be traveling around getting
enough hardware devices that you can reach that threshold.
And the other thing about making this a really usable system is that we also have health
checks available.
We have the ability for the user to essentially do key rotations and swap out devices that
get lost or broken or compromised without even having to reach out to CASA for help.
It's just a simple wizard that you can walk through within the app.
And this ties into even more of a reason to use the mobile device is that we realized
that people carry their mobile devices with them everywhere.
And arguably, sometimes even more than a birth certificate or a social security card or government
ID, people keep track of their phones always on their person.
And whether it's Candy Crush data or maybe it's a favorite photo or something, there
are data valuables that are already on those phones, and people treat them very personally.
And they protect those devices.
And from that side, people usually have it on them.
And so if they're traveling from one location, say it's a home to an office or to this third
location that could be even in a different city, they're going to have their phone on
them.
They're going to use that as a communication tool.
And so using that as the tool to be totally asynchronous and sign.
You could go, you could sign the first one on one day, go two or three days later if
you wanted to in a totally different city and signing.
And then you've maintained the distance between those two signings.
And within that time span, that also means an attacker has to maintain that distance.
It is true that an attacker could hold you at gunpoint or do something more aggressive.
But even in that case, they're still going to have to go these distances.
And the more time that's, we're just raising the bar there.
The more time that's required to go these distances and the more people and places you
have to go, the higher likelihood that someone gets caught, someone gets noticed.
You could, you know, whether it's actually kind of saying safe words, even have like,
that's part of our service around this is we even have safe words and specific process
and emergency lockdown buttons and all these other features that are built in.
But it comes to that usability of having the asynchronous nature where you can go different
places, but having that usability to where you're always kind of seeing the command center
kind of on the phone.
Yeah.
I think that's the thing as well that maybe might not be apparent that a customer can
sign up in a more pseudonymous way.
Can you talk to that?
Sure.
So, you know, at CASA, we are not a bank or a financial institution.
We're a software service provider.
Within the context of actually managing keys, CASA only ever has one out of N of your key
set.
So those keys are always kept completely offline and requires, you know, manual human recovery
process to be gone through, usually a process that can take multiple days.
This is also, you know, configurable by each user and how they want that to be done on
the CASA side.
But the general gist of it is that CASA is going to be helping the user help themselves
is the best way that I know how to put it.
The downside to this is that, you know, whenever you're into a situation where you are not
taking the time or don't have the level of knowledge that you can do everything all by
yourself without asking anyone for help, obviously that's going to be the best proxy.
But if you want to save time, if you want to have expert guidance, then there has to
be some sort of communication.
There has to be at least some sort of, you know, pseudonymous email address or other
communication endpoint for us to have back and forth.
So while we are not a financial institution, we don't do AML KYC, we don't actually care
about your government identity.
We do need to have some way to communicate with you in case something goes wrong.
If, like Jeremy said, if you hit the emergency lockdown and we basically refuse to allow
any signatures to be added for anything, then you'll need to go through a process in order
for us to unfreeze the account.
Or if you lose a sufficient number of devices that you need CASA to dig the cold storage
key out and sign it, you'll need to go through additional processes because at that point,
if we believe that you may have been compromised, we need to ask for some other, you know, non-identifying
questions but some sort of authentication questions, whether it's, you know, things
that you know, special phrases or words, or even, you know, photos of either yourself
or objects or, you know, it's basically any type of unique identifiers that you are comfortable
with using that would be difficult if not impossible for an attacker to replicate.

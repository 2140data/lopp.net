Hello sorry some technical difficulties this is my first time hosting I'm
taking over from Matt Fay who's usually here and today I'm being joined by
Jameson Lopp who doesn't really need much of an introduction this space is
going to be talking about the well self-custody and how to make it safe so
the reason that we've invited Lopp to join this space and Jameson sorry is a
habit to call him Lopp is because we want to kind of give an unbiased
introduction to the idea that you can self-custody your coins without the need
to be a complete expert and what the best way to go about it is so hi Jameson
maybe I can just check that your mic is working all right I think it is yeah
perfect so the format of this space will be I have prepared some questions for
Jameson and hopefully there'll be a good starter to get us talking about what it
takes to self-custody and how we go about understanding self-custody so
during the course of this I'll be letting some other people up to speak so
if you have something to say something ask Jameson feel free to request and I
will let you up one by one so to kick it off let's just start with Jameson when
you please just introduce yourself and your work and how you see your work
today sure so I am a computer scientist by trade I spent the first 10 years of
my career doing fairly standard software as a service web applications
specifically in the email marketing industry where over the years I worked
my way towards the back end of basically doing large-scale distributed data
processing and so suffice to say I was doing almost the antithesis of a lot of
what I do and preach today which is that I was ingesting petabytes and petabytes
of raw tracking data and helping companies basically figure out what their
customers were doing in order to try to better target and sell stuff to them and
so that was never a passion of mine it just provided some very interesting
technical scaling challenges and of course over that period I really came to
learn just how much surveillance really happens as you're going about your day
using the internet so eventually I became interested in Bitcoin about 10
years ago I started a few side projects I forked Bitcoin core not as a different
protocol or a different network or token but rather the actual software puts a
bunch of instrumentation logic into it to try to help people better understand
what the actual Bitcoin nodes were doing and that was just the beginning of what
has turned into many different projects eventually I was fortunate enough to go
full-time in 2015 and spent three years building infrastructure for bit go
that's when I really got deep into self-custody and private key security
and multi-signature aspects of these protocols and that was really focused on
helping enterprises secure their hot wallets which is a big challenge in this
space as we all know there's been quite a history of large custodians getting
hacked and losing lots of money over the years so that goes primary goal while I
was there was to help prevent future huge hacks didn't have a 100% success
rate but we did learn a lot and kept getting better and better over the years
unfortunately when it comes to security a lot of the lessons have to be learned
the hard way and after doing that for three years made a very small pivot to
basically do the same thing use multi-signature functionality within
these protocols to help self-custody but instead I decided to focus on helping
individuals do that because I felt like there was still a huge gap a huge amount
of knowledge that was required in order to do self-custody really well and so I
just wanted to make that easier more accessible for people and at CASA we
have been providing multi-sig solutions now since 2018 and actually Trezor is
one of the building pieces that we use on our platform and I've been using
Trezor devices myself since I think 2015 or so and we felt like in order to help
people self-custody you know especially if you're talking about non-trivial
amounts of money the very first thing you have to do is get those private keys
off of internet connected devices and so Trezor has been you know a great piece
of hardware over the years to help people do that and we're very fortunate
to be using it and other similar pieces of hardware to build out robust software
to help people tackle this problem and it is a giant problem I think we'll go
into a lot of different aspects of that. Great so it sounds like you've kind of
found a greater and greater motivation as you've twisted your original
experiences into Bitcoin and channeled it more and more towards the individual.
Would you say that it's a big motivation for you to help people
self-custody? Do you feel like it's a personal mission of yours or? Yeah it's
it's weird because you know this space is crazy complicated like over the past
ten years the ecosystem around these technologies has exploded in complexity
and there is countless different teams and projects and people that are
exploring all types of different things that you can do with this technology and
and it's you know it's it's at the point now where even I or you know
someone who is full-time in the space cannot possibly keep up with all the
different directions that things are going and you know for the past six
years now I've been focused on pretty much the same old boring thing which is
just trying to keep these tiny amounts of data these private keys safe and and
make it easier for the average non-technical person to do that and it
it may not be the most exciting and glamorous thing it's certainly not
something that's easy to you know market but I feel like it is fundamental that
we continue to improve this and we have to get it right otherwise all of the
other cool and crazy stuff that's being built on top of private key
cryptographic technology is is not going to work or at least it's not going to
work at a mainstream level we need for people not only to you have the
theoretical ability to self-custody and be their own banks we need for people to
be comfortable and confident that they can do it and you know not be worried
about making one mistake and having catastrophic loss and you know it's a
personal problem too I think anyone who has been in the space long enough
probably has some stories of either you know loss or theft or something that has
gone wrong I mean I was actually just making a transaction I think last
weekend and and realized like two seconds after I broadcast the Bitcoin
transaction that I had one of the outputs off by an order of magnitude
thankfully I was able to do a replace by fee and fix my mistake you know before
it got confirmed in the blockchain but that's just the type of thing that I'm
talking about is that you know I was using a single signature wallet for that
and I was just being slightly less careful than I should have been and that
it could have ended up being basically a thousand or multi-thousand dollar
mistake if I hadn't then caught it within a few seconds so you know this
I think the underlying theme to all of this this whole space self-custody
self-sovereignty all of that is that it has great potential and great power that
the functionality offers to mankind but this also comes with great
responsibility and unfortunately in many cases great brittleness you know
basically a lot of potential for people to make a single mistake and have
something go terribly wrong so there's just there's still just so much left to
do that I have not gotten bored remaining focused on this very low-level problem
that is great to hear I think people kind of overestimate the glamour behind
cryptography they see these private keys as some mathematical Mecca whereas the
trouble is it's it's literally just a string and people don't really see it as
something that they can tangibly protect but I think you also touched upon a
point is that most people have had this experience where they've lost some money
to to an oversized fee or they they've actually been scammed out of their the
private of their recovery phrase and there's not the holistic approach to
security I think that's something that's missing people don't expect to perhaps
be be swatted like something that happened to you in the past or having
their their sims swapped and so on and so they don't see these as attack vectors
if we can go back to that part of your life I know it's probably a sensitive
one but I know it's something you've also talked about by a lot was there was
that a wake-up call for you of it of some form did what did it just confirm
something you already knew or or did you suddenly reevaluate everything at that
point yeah it was one of those things where I wasn't surprised like I knew
theoretically that it was a possibility that someone who was determined could
find my address and send a SWAT team and basically create a huge annoyance if not
a very life-threatening situation for me but it's one of those your edge case
type of thought exercises where it's really hard to believe that something
like that could happen to you so it was definitely a wake-up call and I certainly
don't expect it to ever happen again especially not after all of the
protections that put in place but it has been a it's been four years now actually
I think it was 11 days ago was four year anniversary of that happening and I put
out a tweet where I basically said you know this is still ongoing the the case
is not closed but I am I am optimistic that I'll be able to share more about it
but you know it's it's the how does the phrase go an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cleanup or solution or whatever I'm sure I'm bashing that
phrase but the point being that you know if I had put in the the time and effort
upfront then I wouldn't have had to deal with the countless hours of both you
know re-creating my life with a whole new level of privacy and security and
paying for all these private investigators and attorneys and dealing
with the criminal justice system which is just incredibly onerous and I think
you know one thing that I can definitely say right now about my whole experience
going through the criminal justice system as a victim is that I can't
imagine having to go through this process if you were an average person who
like didn't have expendable resources to put into it because it took years to
even get really attention from federal investigators and I basically had to use
networking and use money to even get to the point where I think anybody would
take me seriously because this this is one of those crimes that almost always
goes unpunished but I am hopeful that the criminal justice system seems to be
slowly catching up and I think there was actually an announcement from the
Department of Justice recently where they're actually focusing on creating a
whole new like cyber criminal division and this is something that I think has
really been a problem ever since the internet started going mainstream is
that the way the justice system was set up historically you know pretty much all
the crimes were local crimes and so your local jurisdiction therefore would be
the ones that were tasked with investigating and prosecuting and
sentencing and all of that for whoever the criminal was but now that the
crimes can cross jurisdictions so easily very commonly in criminal cases like
this it gets escalated to the federal level so essentially you know in the
United States the the federal law enforcement system is completely
overwhelmed like they can't possibly keep up with all this stuff and the
states feel like they don't have the jurisdiction but I think that's changing
and unfortunately you know I may be a part of that change but I think it's
something that has to happen so it sounds like the message there is just to
do everything you can to avoid that which I suppose is why we're on this
call is talking about anonymity talking about security of your key critical data
and the more you preserve that the less likely likely you are to have to deal
with the US federal justice system so from that perspective what do you see as
the biggest priorities for the next five years of your work let's say in the
Bitcoin space and maybe after that we can open up to the audience and so if
you do have a question please start requesting that by the way this is being
recorded so if you don't want to be recorded please don't request anyway
back to you James yeah so like I said I'm I think I'm still just gonna be
focused on low-level private key management but the question that it it
really comes down to is if you can get to the point that we can make security a
usable acquirable state by the average person then where do we go from there
and Casa has never fundamentally considered itself just a Bitcoin
company we consider ourselves like a self-sovereignty company and that our
thesis is that private keys are going to be pun intended I guess the key
to an enormous amount of functionality in the future and it just so happens to
be that right now the the most obvious way to take advantage of that the power
of private keys is with money itself you know that there obviously are plenty of
other things that you can do like with GPG but the usability around that is
horrendous and point being like I said at the very beginning there are so many
other teams and projects that are building really really cool stuff on top
you know multiple layers of this technology that we want to be able to
facilitate as much of that as possible and there's going to be trade-offs
there's going to be different I guess gradients of the security and
convenience scale so while I've mostly been focused on the extreme end of
super duper high security for you know life-changing amounts of value which
means people are going to be willing to put up with a fair amount of
inconvenience in order to get that high level of security we recognize that
that's not what all of the functionality in the space is going to be based around
there are going to be things where you're going to want to be signing and
transacting and doing more interactive stuff on a day-to-day basis maybe those
are financial transactions maybe they are like identity and reputation and
social media based transactions I don't pretend to have like the specific
knowledge of exactly how the space is going to go but I think that you know
more and more of our lives is going to be based around private keys so from
from that aspect the the question becomes you know how do we continue to
provide better and better user experience but do so in a way that people
can do more complex and more convoluted stuff and and that's where it gets
scary right now I think we'll probably talk about a number of these scary
things but um you know even even within I guess a lot of the like Ethereum and
DeFi stuff that's out there right now there are some scary things that are
being exploited where even if you have a hardware wallet it may not be enough to
protect you and that's that's where you know we need to keep making improvements
both on the hardware and the software side as the whole space becomes more
complex yeah I think you're on to something the the idea of not
considering yourself a Bitcoin company raises a lot of questions about
security when you're considering chains that are centralized and therefore they
get their security from there but they they do have these inherent vulnerabilities
in their smart contracts and so on and perhaps when we're talking about scams
in the space we talk about scams being people trying to fish you and fishing
websites and things like that but we also talk about the projects themselves
being scams and I feel like there's something to be said for that do your
own research tribe and people who who recommend more of a critical thing more
critical thinking when it comes to what you're doing with your money and I feel
like the crypto space is kind of moving away from that so do you consider that
scams in general are are in these two camps or would you say that it's all one
problem that we can address at the same time it's really hard I think to say
that you know all of the problems that are leading people to part with their
money when they end up regretting it or didn't intend to our scams so I'm I'm
generally not a fan of the word scan like I prefer to be more specific about
exactly what is happening and that's because scan is just such an umbrella
term that can encompass so many different ways of either you know
technically tricking someone or just doing some sort of social engineering
which I often refer to as you know hacking someone's brain to get them to
basically authenticate and bypass all of the technical security mechanisms that
that have been put in place I mean there are of course projects that are obvious
like ICO scans that are you know they have no intention of ever building the
things that they're trying to build but then on the other hand there are tokens
and networks out there that are really gray area borderline it's you know more
like like Theranos kind of like fake it till you make it like we know that they
can't do what they claim they may one day be able to do but who knows you
can't you know you can't prove a negative you can't prove that someone
will never be able to you know achieve some sort of functionality that they
claim that they're building so that's where it gets a lot I think trickier but
then of course there are there are also a decent number of people in the space
probably mostly newbies will fall prey to scams that we all consider to be
obvious you know the like crypto doubler scams like the fake Elon Musk's and fake
celebrities who say that you know if you send them so much Bitcoin or Ethereum or
whatever they'll double or triple it you know that's obvious but there's we've
also seen just a lot of other social engineering scams that happen as a
result of data leaks and you know you might get scareware or blackmail
messages they might you know claim to have like hacked your computer and have
photos or video of you and compromising positions I think those are called sex
torsion scams there's there's even at a technical level fake airdrops and and
so you know because airdrops are a real thing there have been people that have
created malicious software forks that will say you know if you own this much
of a token you just install this software and you'll get the same amount
of this new token but if you install that software it'll actually steal all
your money there's just so many different ways you know we could
enumerate through dozens if not hundreds of them but the point is you know this
is this is a never-ending problem and so while I generally focus on technically
securing private key data and and doing that can protect people against certain
types of quote-unquote scams at the end of the day there is no technical
solution to the human problem of you getting simply tricked into
authenticating and sending your money somewhere the one thing that I would say
that I do like about multi-signature aspects of storing your wealth
especially if you're if you're storing the keys far away from each other so you
have to physically travel and this becomes onerous of course is that I
think that it's less likely that you will fall victim to your human nature of
greediness and just clicking on something and sending some money because
you thought that it was going to be profitable for you maybe that'll give
you more time to think about exactly what you're doing before you send your
money somewhere and then you know sometimes sometimes this isn't
necessarily even like a doubler scam you know there have even been services that
claim to be like privacy mixing services and I guess even just going back to some
of the original quote-unquote scams exchange exit stands there have been
plenty of those and so this is once again you know why self-custody is
important is you never know what somebody might do if they have the keys
yeah I think that covers the many fact many yeah factors of scamming very well
rather than dwelling on this maybe we can go back to the idea of hacking your
brain against hacking your device so I suppose one of those would be considered
info sec and the other up sec so would you maybe have any what could you first
maybe describe those two approaches to security and do you believe that there's
some combination in there that would be able to help people avoid these things
or do you think that it's more about the schema having having that multi signature
set up that limits what you're able to what mistakes you're able to make do you
think that's maybe the only way to go yeah I mean I think they're very
similar though I generally think of info sec more in enterprise terms when you
know you're holding on to a lot of data and trying to figure out how to best
classify it is you know different levels of sensitivity and thus how to restrict
access to it whereas I think off sec is something that every individual should
be thinking about and it's it's more around you know how do I prevent third
parties from getting any sensitive data or you know isn't as little data as
possible on me so that it can't be used against me because the one the
commonality between all of this is that nowadays with the internet information
wants to be free information flows at the speed of light information is hard
to secure it's the same reason why there are so many businesses that are built
around securing private keys all we're really doing is securing you know a few
hundred bytes of information but that information is of some of the utmost
importance and utmost sensitivity when I was working at the the big data
marketing company back in the day and we were in the early days of cloud
computing and storing hundreds of petabytes of raw metrics on our own
clusters we had people try to hack into us or social engineer any of our clients
in order to get into their accounts and so on and so forth and we didn't have
private keys like Bitcoin didn't even exist back then but what we had was
information which was the next best thing and even though we told our
customers you know we are not a like HIPAA compliant you know highly secure
database like don't put sensitive information into our API's and into our
database they did it anyways and so a number of our customers would put
anything from social security numbers to credit card numbers so you know names
addresses everything that you can imagine and of course that stuff has
value back then it was primarily used for identity theft if you know criminal
organizations got a handle on it but you know that's why we have a number of
different attempts and a few successful intrusions usually because of problems
with the actual clients themselves not our own infrastructure but nonetheless
they were still able to get in and siphon off large amounts of data and so
this that you know that was more of an info sec problem though there wasn't a
ton that we could do about it other than try to monitor what the data our
customers were putting in to our own databases were and tell them to stop
being idiots whereas off sec is something that I think about every day
you know I I I went out and ran some errands today and had to go give some
contact information to a service so that they could get back to me when they were
done and you know I had because I don't give people my real name address phone
number so on and so forth unless it's absolutely necessary you know I had to
decide you know what pseudonym am I gonna give this service which of my
burner virtual phone numbers am I going to give them and the reason that I do
that and it is it's annoying it's onerous but now I know that I don't
have to worry about what that particular service providers info sec is you know I
don't I have to assume that they're all idiots and they're gonna get hacked or
leaked it leak it or sell it or you know do something because that's just the
nature of information these days so yeah like I said up sec is what I think most
of the listeners in this audience need to be worrying about you know protect
your own data prevent as many entities as possible from having it because you
don't know what the info sec practices and policies are of everyone that you're
interacting with that's that's a great answer I think we're we're kind of
looking to you for this as this kind of model of how to do it would you say
there's anything that you could share about say a minimum viable approach to
to to op sec where a newcomer could reevaluate how they're approaching
things now and decide what they're going to do to secure their their most
critical data how would they go about doing that and in the meantime if anyone
wants to request to speak feel free we're we're open to any questions yeah I
mean entire books have been written about this and the short version that I
tell people at least if you're American you should spend 30 or 40 dollars on
Amazon and buy the most recent edition I think it's the third edition now of
extreme privacy by Michael Buzell and you'll see I think it's like 500 pages
now it seems like each new edition adds another hundred pages it's because
there's so many different aspects of your life that you can worry about and
you know I am an extreme example I don't expect most people are gonna use
burner phone numbers or set up intricate systems of physical emailers so that
they can still receive packages without giving away you know what geographic
location they're in but you don't have to start out at the extreme you can
incrementally improve your privacy you know you can make it like a weekend
hobby project where you just spend an hour to each weekend looking at your own
life and saying okay I can make this one slight change and that's really what it
all is it's when it comes to privacy and opsec it is about making changes to your
habits and you need to basically reprogram yourself it after you've been
doing it for a few years it becomes second nature but you know I can tell
you from experience that going around and giving a pseudonym especially like
in social situations it it feels really weird at least for the first year or so
and then eventually you start to easily start you know automatically responding
to that pseudonym which you know is important if you don't want to be too
weird but once again I don't expect people to go around and not give their
real name at least to friends that they're meeting it just depends on what
your threat model is and I think a lot of people aren't gonna have the
same threat model as myself because you know I am fairly high profile at least
in this niche space I do work for a company that is focused on security for
a lot of high net worth people and I'm sure there were people there are people
out there who would love to get their hands on me and try to torture me and
get sensitive information out of me not that it would get them anything because
we've set up our own infrastructure in a way so that I'm not a single point of
failure our own company is not a single point of failure but somebody would
probably be willing to try because they figure the potential reward might be
worth it so that's I guess the the short version is there are things that you can
do the easiest thing that anybody can do is just protect your day-to-day web
usage you know install ad blockers consider setting up a VPN they're
actually really easy to do these days a lot of VPN providers out there will have
you know executable software that you can run it'll automatically just run in
the background whenever your computer starts up so it really is not nearly as
difficult as it was you know 10 15 years ago so just by protecting like your day
to day email browsing and usage you know that'll do a really good job you know
putting you ahead of like 99% of the rest of people just preventing all of
your web browsing from being correlated together and like I said I was the guy
who used to be doing that so I know exactly how much information is being
scooped up and analyzed okay yeah I think that's that's really reassuring to
hear from you that VPN is going to do anything for your privacy I think a lot
of people are dubious about that the trust and so on that's involved but
instead of diving into that I've added Mike as a speaker so hi Mike yeah thank
you not the best speaker but uh I've got something on my mind here I've been
quite surprised that I have not seen it more utilized I've been in the IT space
for many years and though I'm not the best speaker I think myself to be quite
a guru when it comes to cryptography that's my compassion I just want to put
something out there I'm surprised that I haven't seen it utilized more what I
love about crypto is that you know mainly if I was just swiped up and put
into a jungle buck naked I could come out and have my money it's a beautiful
thing I've toyed around with the idea of having you know how can I secure my
seeds with so I use a lot of encryption I talk about encryption a lot you know
minors you could put your seed words encrypted on a billboard and be safe
with nobody been able to to know what those were but the average bear cannot
remember 12 to 24 words one of the things I've done and I say that you know
I'm surprised no one's utilized this is it's taking you know a key phrase let's
use like Satoshi Nakamoto as an example if you take Satoshi Nakamoto and in
very any variation whether it be capital S's all capital you're going to get a
hundred and twenty eight bits of data in binary and I believe strongly that the
when it comes right down to it is trusting our randomness is is the issue
here do we trust it software level hardware level so one of the scripts as
an example in Coleman has a great script out there you know utilized offline that
would allow you to use binary as your randomness so if you take a converter
and you convert Satoshi Nakamoto just as an example you're going to get 128 bits
of data which equals 12 seed words right if you're using that as your
randomness in binary form so one of the things that I do is I have a phrase in
my head that will equate to at least 128 bits to make it more complicated you
could kind of back out if it ends up being more you could back out and still
have that 128 bits or 256 for the keywords so all you really have to
remember is one phrase converted to binary and that is your randomness and
I'm surprised there's not a platform that has not utilized that whether it be to
educate people to utilize that system because the key here is we are the
weakest link so if we're storing 12 or 24 words on a document or you know on
the cloud and we got some rogue dropbox administer you know searching for key
words to get those so that that's that's a big deal right there well I can tell
you why I can give you several reasons why that's not a common thing and so
what you're essentially describing is a brain wallet and there are a few well
you know we're just talking about data and entropy so you know you can come up
with your own scheme but there there are a few schemes out there for brain
wallets that have been developed over the years the first thing that I would
suggest you go check out is search for a piece of software called brain flare
there's an entire talk actually that was given a number of years ago by the
author of brain flare and basically what they showed is that they can do what is
essentially a dictionary attack and very easily sweep up funds from brain
wallets that are using you know human generated phrases you know a lot of
people tend to use popular phrases that can be found in literature or pop
culture or whatever and he basically found that he could you know create a
dictionary attack and run these servers 24-7 that are just listening to
deposits on the network and listening for deposits to billions of different
addresses that he's already pre-generated and found the private keys
for you know all these different permutations and he managed to steal
hundreds if not thousands of Bitcoin thankfully he was a white hat hacker and
you know he gave as much of it back as he was able to find the owners to but
the reason that this is a problem and I think you touched on it is that humans
are not good sources of entropy and you know you said you know how can we find
really any good random number generator that we can trust and probably I would
say the best solution to that would be dice where if you get some like casino
grade dice that are you know fair to roll there there are ways for you to you
know roll them like a hundred times and and generate really really good entropy
that you can then use to generate your own keys if you don't want to trust
these hardware devices to generate them themselves that's just the technical
reason why it's not great the next reason is actually a long-term issue I
think the idea that brain wallets can be used to like portably and you know
concealably transport private keys across the world that's a great great use
case if you're like a refugee or something I would not put money in them
for more than like a few days and that's only if it was really really good random
entropy you know I would only do that for a short trip if I was like in a
dire situation needing to escape from some terrible situation but um back to
the the bigger point is that there whenever you create any sort of setup
for securing private keys you also need to think about inheritance you know what
happens if you get hit by a truck because you know we as humans are
fragile single points of failure and if if you're in the situation where you
have any sort of heirs or beneficiaries and you don't want your money to end up
just being permanently lost then you do need to have some way for the people
that you care about to be able to recover those funds and that gets into a
really weird tricky security situation of like how do you do that in a way that
then isn't giving complete custody to these people right now so that they
could steal your funds from you and it we spent basically a whole year at CASA
thinking through inheritance problems there's also some good inheritance
guides out there I would recommend buying Pamela Morgan's crypto asset
inheritance guide I learned a lot from reading that inheritance is its own
complicated issue and and that's less because of technical factors and just
because of human factors very good thanks for letting me speak guys hey
guys thanks for letting me up I have a I have a quick question and I'm sorry if
this has already come up I just joined the space a little late my question is
like for some some good measures for like a digital nomad where you know
necessary like keeping seed phrase in a safe in a home location really doesn't
make sense you know because you know a digital nomad may not have access to
that property and also might not feel secure leaving their seed there while
you know they're elsewhere moving around the world so yeah I was just I have a
few per cut or a few methods I use myself but I would love to just get yeah
your take lop if you if you've got some some good ideas there yeah this is a
challenge and I mean I move around a fair about myself but I'm not really
like a full-time digital nomad there I think once again it comes down to what
do you need to be able to access immediately what do you need to be able
to access with a short or medium amount of delay and what are you willing to
to to sock away long term that's like really really hard to access because at
least for the former which like I said is really what or for the latter which
is what I've mostly focused on that like if you have the majority of your net
worth it's being secured by private keys I make some assumptions here which is
that you know you're probably not trading it you're probably not selling
it or moving it like more than once every few months if then you may only
move it once every few years and for for that level of security even a digital
nomad I would expect has some sort of semi trusted friends and family and
that's a good way to essentially create some sort of either multi say or like
Shamir secret sharing your sharded backup solution where you're giving
pieces of data to a group of people that you don't necessarily fully trust but
you somewhat trust and they they're not taking custody of it they don't even
have the ability to access it but this is really what I did a number of years
ago before I was really even using multi SIG and I have a blog post about it but
the the short version is I would use some encryption software I guess I was
using true crypts back then but now you want to use Vera crypts because that's
sort of the successor to true crypt and I would I would take all of my backup
information all of my sensitive data and I would create a fully encrypted data
partition with that and I would take I would generate you're using like a
password manager or something some sort of search of entropy I would generate
an extremely long random set of characters as the encryption phrase so
something that's so long that even I didn't know what it was and then I would
use Shamir secret sharing tool to split up that decryption phrase and I would
give copies of the encrypted volume to you know this handful of different people
friends and family and I would give them one piece of the decryption phrase
along with of course the actual Shamir secret sharing software and instructions
for how to use it and stuff and you know it's it's onerous to do and you
certainly need to make sure that you you test the the whole setup and make sure
that the people who have that know how to use it and that's sort of your like
emergency you know everything went wrong type of backup you know the final fail
safe in case whatever data or hardware devices or whatever that you keep on you
get completely lost or destroyed otherwise you know for just sort of the
the more short-term faster to access stuff then at least using a hardware
device to keep that private key offline is good if you then want to have to deal
with things like the physical security of it then I think treasure would tell
you that you you should be using the additional 25th word passphrase so that
no attacker can get their hands on the keys and whatever you're doing here you
know you should also have backed up preferably on that like final backstop
solution but without going off you know into tangents of all of the other
permutations like it it really depends right it depends on how how much you're
moving around what the jurisdictions you're in are like you know what your
your threat level is so I don't know how helpful all of this is because it has to
be really high level in vague there are so many variables at play that you know
you have to take into consideration exactly what you're doing and I don't
expect you to know docs yourself in your personal situation here in public yeah
no I appreciate that that was very helpful I've been I've been honestly
considering the multi-sig approach which I think is is pretty clever and just you
know yeah instilling a few people that I trust very well with with different
different keys to yet to hold but yeah I like that idea of of maybe sectioning
off the majority of my stack with that most secure method of multi-sig with
with very trusted friends and family yeah and then my current I think yeah
and then my current setup too has been like I basically and I'm curious like
how at risk you think this setup would be but like with an air gap computer I
encrypted my keys and then have been hosting that encryption through another
go through keybase which has a different set of keys so as like a as a as a file
server so I have access to it at all times however in order to yeah get
access to my keys you need you have to have like key base installed and then I
had to have to have you know the other keys in order to decrypt actually
actually get my my stack if that makes sense it's a little early for me yeah
yeah no absolutely like a fully encrypted backup that's also on the
cloud this is so if you really really know what you're doing you know in
general I say like what people are if people are using air gapped computers
like you'd better be an amazing expert who really really knows what you're
doing because it's it's almost impossible to really be sure that your
computer is air gapped but once again like all of these things that comes
down to exactly what your threat level is what are you trying to protect
yourself against so you know theoretically if you've done everything
correct if you have an amazing complex encryption passphrase on that that file
volume you're uploading you know through key base or really any cloud service
then it's probably fine you're certainly orders of magnitude better than the
people who just take their seed phrase and put it in Evernote but you know
anything that you're putting on the internet I think you should assume that
that you know the service itself may have an employee that decides to you
trawl through all the files and and you know puts them on a cluster they're
trying to you know crack with a bunch of GPUs or something so it's it's it's
hard to say that it's 100% foolproof but it's probably okay it's just not
something that I would recommend to anyone who you know isn't really really
deep into this stuff and so without knowing you and all your skill set I
wouldn't comment one way or another one thing kind of going back to the multi
sig or distributed key setup is that you know if you have a huge amount of money
that you very rarely need access to or or really even you know we have some
clients who ask us you know how do I set up nation-state level robustness you
know the only way to really get that level of robustness is to not have a
spending threshold of keys in one jurisdiction you know if you if you go
under the assumption that you or whoever is holding a key in any given
jurisdiction may find themselves put in a cage and otherwise tortured or coerced
into using that key or whatever keys they have access to then you know the
only foolproof way to be secure against that is to not have the keys there if we
have to assume the humans are single points of failure then it is helpful if
you happen to have your friends and family who are scattered across
different jurisdictions who could essentially act as key holders because
they don't even have to know about each other you can be managing and
coordinating a multi sig setup and when and if you need a signature you can send
that request to each of those different key holders separately they don't have
to communicate with each other they only have to communicate with you they don't
even necessarily have to know each other exists for the signing interaction and
and you know this is one somewhat convenient way of being able to
transact but of course once again there's a lot of variables here you you
have to think about you know what could go wrong is it possible that you could
lose contact with or you know lose a sufficient number of those key holders
if they're not cooperating with you and you might get locked out of your funds
until you can then go to whatever your super secure ultimate backup solution is
to retrieve enough key material to reconstitute the wallet on your own but
just a few thoughts I just like to jump in with an observation that our last two
speakers have both come up with let's say a customized security schema of their
own and I was just wondering perhaps we should be pointing out the the purpose
of standardization as a way of actually in ensuring that your security setup is
going to going to last into the future yeah so this is this is just something
that is extremely common that we see with people who are talking to us we
call it the treasure hunt solution where essentially you know people create their
own treasure maps and you know that works usually it works pretty well from a
security standpoint but you know the problem with security at least in this
space is it's far too easy to achieve 100% security which means that no one
including yourself is able to access those keys so you know we're walking
this really fine line here where we want to still be able to access the keys in
the right circumstances but we we don't want you know the wrong people to be
able to access them. Great and we have another speaker here Karabot if you have
a question please feel free.
Okay perhaps not going to happen maybe then we can continue with some other
questions just about perhaps the idea that that securing the Bitcoin is very
very uncertain and the the general public that kind of need to rethink how
security works so how do we approach the masses with the question of security
for Bitcoin? Well this is also it's one of our thesis is that users don't read
the manual and so we you know we can write all of the documentation and all
of the best practices and I certainly have written countless articles and it's
like support knowledge base questions but people are lazy people want to take
the path of least resistance to achieve their goals so what we need to do is we
need to build the hardware and software that provides as low friction of an
experience as possible while guiding the users down the path of following best
practices like following the best practices should not even be a question
it should just be presented as you know this is the way that you are going to do
it that that can be especially in Bitcoin a aggravating thing for power
users CASA specifically designs its software not to facilitate a number of
different pieces of functionality of things that you can do with Bitcoin and
this is a conscious design decision on our part because in many cases we think
it's more dangerous to let the the novice users have access to these foot
guns then it is worse the benefit of letting the power users access certain
functionality so you know one example around that which I've actually given
an entire talks around is that you've probably heard that your Bitcoin
supports time-locking functionality and time-locking functionality does get used
in other like second layer protocols I think some of the coinjoin stuff may use
it a lightning network definitely uses it but I'm not aware of any wallets that
just give you a like a single field and say hey how long do you want to lock
your coins for and there's a number of reasons for this one is that I think it
would be really easy for someone to shoot themselves in the foot and lock
their coins until after they're dead which of course once again is achieving
100% security another is that it creates actually a lot of complexity around
backups it actually breaks the ability to have deterministic backups but
there's a lot of things like this that you can do in Bitcoin your Bitcoin is a
protocol Bitcoin has a programming language you can create complicated or
somewhat relatively complicated you can call them smart contracts you know
they're spending conditions essentially you're building these redeemed scripts
that describe how the coins are able to be spent and like once you get down to
that level there's a ton of ways that you can screw up and you know
accidentally lock yourself out of your own coins the number of these examples
happened in the early days of Bitcoin I think even Mount Gox screwed up and like
locked themselves out of like 10,000 coins for all time and thankfully as far
as I'm aware that seems to be happening less often these days because I think
people are developers who are building wallets are more often using standardized
libraries like they're not actually building the Bitcoin script you know one
one function call at a time they're using other standard libraries to do
that and that once again it helps provide safety rails from shooting
yourself in the foot and that's the same type of thing that we need to keep
happening at higher levels up in the application stack yeah that's great
answer I think maybe based on that what would you tell the listeners here today
well I know I for one get asked all the time oh how do I get into Bitcoin and
then what do I do with it and I'm going to tell people send people to an exchange
or to an ATM or something but what kind of advice can you give to someone like
that to get them to safely start using Bitcoin and know that they're securing
it properly and know that they're not going to go down some dark alley on the
internet and lose all their coins what's that's that first elevator question or
elevator pitch that you can make yeah well start small ease into it you know
much like with the privacy stuff that we're talking about early on like you
don't have to jump in headfirst you know you don't have to put your life savings
into Bitcoin and then you know potentially make one catastrophic
mistake and lose it all buy $20 worth buy $100 worth play around with it try
out different software buy different hardware devices see which ones work
best for you and you know there's there's like I said there's so many
different ways to do self-testing there's dozens if not hundreds of
different wallets out there that can help facilitate and they have different
levels of usability and security and you know for a novice they probably don't
really have any way of differentiating you know what the actual security is so
you know the best way if if you get to the point where you have you know more
than probably a thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin you should really be looking
at making an investment of five to ten percent of that in a hardware device get
those private keys off the internet that gives you additional layers of
protection you know when you're actually spending it because you can verify the
details of those transactions on this independent hardware and firmware so you
don't you you don't have to worry about things like your actual wallet software
being compromised for example and it can be overwhelming this is something that
I've spent really ten years immersed in and I can you know rattle off tens or
hundreds of different potential vulnerabilities in ways that you you can
lose your money but that's only because I've been around for so long I've seen
so many things happen and you know we shouldn't we shouldn't expect that users
are going to know all of that everything that can go wrong all of the history
I think it's really just a matter of being conservative and being careful
you know when you're when you're actually sending Bitcoin when you're
sending a cryptographic bearer asset it just requires that you change your
mindset it's not like going to the store and buying something with a credit card
it's like paying for something with you know cash or a bar of gold you're not
gonna be able to get it back if that other person doesn't want to give it to
you so I think that this actually this goes beyond just like the individual and
it's actually sort of a cultural paradigm shift that needs to happen but
I don't expect that it will happen quickly this this may be a multi
generational shift where over time as adoption of these protocols continues
to increase and as people become more comfortable with using them they also
change their mindset and you know when they're spending money exactly you know
what they're thinking about how careful they're being and I suppose some some
people might say you know it's kind of a difference between a fiat mindset and a
Bitcoin mindset I think there's a lot of things that have changed and will change
just in how we operate our day-to-day lives because of this technology it's
you know it's all just ripple effects from the the attributes of the
technology and how it changes how we interact with other people how we
interact with with the world really from an economic standpoint yeah exciting
stuff we have another speaker here ArcPlate cold storage solution feel free
to speak please hey everyone my name is David Cowan I'm the CEO of ArcPlate and
I manufacture and design cold wallet solutions so there's a whole bunch of
stuff that has been touched on probably a dozen different things that have been
discussed over the past 20 minutes that I would love to speak about them all but
you know I'll touch on a few of them and I've been trying to solve this solution
starting out in digital assets myself and trying to self custody you know not
only for myself but my family members who don't understand digital assets and
how they work and and being able to be trusted with their own wallet safety so
I got into this solely from a family perspective of seeing that self-custody
of digital assets is probably the the biggest problem in this industry that is
not discussed enough so trying to manufacture these things and deal with
several of these issues that were touched on like being able to give your
digital assets as inheritance and finding affordable solutions which person
that they can understand and I see a lot of bottlenecks in the industry and I'd
like to get your opinion on on some of these bottlenecks the first one being is
a universally recognized security standard you know much like the VIP 39
word list or the Shamir word list we have 12 24 25 word wallets some wallet
uses numbers we're all over the place when it comes to a having some form of
industry recognized standardized format that everyone can agree upon and thoughts
on how we might develop a universal standard so that there's no
misunderstanding when it comes to inheritance time what the format is how
to get those assets that type of thing second is is storage when it comes to
physicality and crypto and that's really what I'm into is trying to take a
digital world and have something tangible that you can hold that you can
pass along that's not stored in the cloud and so trying to come up with
solutions not just for us because realistically we are the 1% of the
population the early adopters who who understand this technology to some
extent and unfortunately the reason we're here is that a lot of people still
even in what could be considered the the first wave of adopters still don't
understand it and how are we going to reach mass adoption when it comes to
custody of private keys whether we're going to have pre-issued keys that are
given away at a bank just like a plastic debit card is today so I'd like to again
kind of hear your thoughts on what your beliefs are for the future of issuance
of whatever keys in institutions as well as their custody whether a user may
retain custody themselves whether the institution is going to retain custody
so just a few things and I'll pass it back over here I'd love to hear your
thoughts yeah I don't know if you are familiar with the xkcd comic about
standards but I think that's basically my my retort to how do we get to a
common standard standards you know it's sort of an organic process and yeah
especially if you go to wallets recovery org I believe then you'll see what a
real mess the quote-unquote standards are just even amongst the wallets in the
Bitcoin ecosystem my only hope there is that over time and time probably means
decades we eventually coalesce on to similar standards but you know when you
go look through the bits if I recall correctly like that's 39 as a standard
is actually discouraged for some reason I forget exactly why and yet almost all
of us are using it because I think it's certainly better to have hierarchical
deterministic wallets than not though you know there are wallets like
Electrum that have a different seed phrase standard that they say is better
I think because it has a birthday or something encoded into it or maybe they
like the word less better who knows but um yeah this is a voluntary system right
everybody can create their own standard and presumably it's a free market then
the best one should bubble to the top but who knows how long that will take as
for you know securing or issuance of keys I mean at least the way things have
been going I suspect that a lot of providers a lot of people are I think
it's an onboarding problem so people are getting onboarded with custodial
providers they are today probably 99% of the on ramp and off ramps and the
system between traditional finance and and the crypto world are these
centralized custodians and so inevitably what happens is newbies who have never
used any sort of bearer asset before and can't even comprehend of what self
custody means they're just used to going into a website and you know trading
buying stuff and and that's you know that's like their interface to their
bank account and their their stock market account and so on and so forth
and so they figure okay these numbers on this screen on this website say that I
own this and that's all there is to it and so they probably never even bother
to try to withdraw because that's just not a functionality that they're used
to having so I think at least for the foreseeable future that's going to be a
really common thing you know that it really requires someone to take the
initiative to learn that self-custody is even an option you know there are some
companies out there that are kind of straddling the line you know I I'm I'm
optimistic that places like Fidelity and Square for example will help educate
users about self-custody as an option but I think in general these companies
are disincentivized from doing so and and one of the main reasons for that is
that you know the the financialization of these assets where they're then
offering other products you know based on holding custody of them and
rehypothecating them and so on and so forth so I'm doing my part I think
that's all I can I can really do is you know those of us who who care about the
overall security and distribution of the system need to keep making it easier
need to keep explaining to people why self-custody is something that they
should care about and you know obviously there's there's the personal incentives
which is that you know the entire point of these systems is to not have to trust
third parties because of all the ways that they can screw with you and then at
an even higher like meta level it's that if we don't have sufficient
distribution and level of self-custody then all we're really doing is you're
recreating a new centralized financial system where all the same tricks are
going to be used against us by a small group of elites and you know worst-case
scenario they are then able to have enough power enough control over enough
value of the system that they might be able to change attributes of the system
as such. Oh definitely that's that's again there's a huge amount of
information when it comes to this and again my focus from the start of this
has been to offer people you know just an alternative way to be able to self
custody and again inheritance was a big thing with that and you know it's it's
curious to think about what the future holds when it comes to key storage as
well as as inheritance and you know when it comes to how I've set things up
personally with my family again I manufacture cold wallets so I've got my
own special models that I have for myself and my family and they're buried
in a known location and that particular location is given to certain family
members and again I will have theirs they will have mine and we know each
other's locations and of course that brings in you know multisig or things
like Shamir where we have the ability to split up into shards and to be able to
have the conceptual of model of having cold wallets as a primary way of
storing digital assets using something like trays or hardware wallets to
actually interface and to have you know a possession of one one of the shards is
with you one of the shards is with your lawyer who has your will and one shard
is with a family member so that at any given point in time you will have access
to another shard or again in the event of a passing some way of passing along
the custody of those assets to the the next person in line for their possession
so what are your thoughts on on inheritance and passing it along to to
the next line yeah that's actually very similar to the solution we ended up
landing on a casa which is like we didn't want to recreate the wheel we
wanted to have an inheritance setup that followed you know established
guidelines for how inheritance already works which is you know you have an
executor you have beneficiaries in many cases you have a variety of different
financial accounts that have beneficiaries listed on them and there are established
ways you know if you have like a brokerage account for example you have
beneficiaries on it there are established ways for those beneficiaries
to essentially prove to the brokerage that you have died that you know they
are the beneficiary they are who they claim they are they should be able to
take control of those accounts and you know we basically did something similar
except that you know we're wrapping it all around private keys and so you're
for a private key based inheritance solution you want everybody who's
involved to know about it you want to have your estate attorney well-informed
and they may be a key holder in a multisig they should certainly have like
the instructions of how it's set up and how to recover those funds and then you
may decide depending upon the the games theory and how you trust people you may
have a beneficiary or two hold a key or two or you may have completely neutral
third parties act as executors who then are key holders and can help manage the
distribution of the assets but this is why inheritance in particular is a
really gnarly problem because it becomes increasingly complex based upon your own
family and your attributes and you know potential personal and social issues and
whatnot awesome well I appreciate your responses I'll let another speaker go
ahead thank you okay yeah we have here Chad I don't know if you can hear us
Chad but you're up next and just in regards to that I feel like inheritance
is one of these really tricky things when it comes to Bitcoin because there
are many ways to approach it and none of them are standardized so I think really
good job for raising that from from arc plates so Chad is not joining I was just
wondering if we could think a bit about the what's acceptable as a security
technology and I was just wondering James what your thought Jameson what
your thoughts are on biometric security in in crypto is it completely avoid is
there a place for it there's been that world coin I didn't want to mention name
but it's everyone knows about it whereas harvesting biometric data and do you
have any concerns about that absolutely so I think my biggest problem and really
any security professionals biggest problem with biometric authentication is
when it's used as a single point of authentication I guess one of the sort
of catchphrases that has become a thing is that biometrics should be considered
usernames and not passwords and there's some good reasons for that mainly you
know for for good password hygiene and good password management you should be
able to change your password if you ever think it's compromised
whereas good luck changing your biometrics if they get leaked and
compromised so I think that there is a place for biometrics as one of a
multi-factor authentication solution perhaps you you use it as like the
initial login of like this is your username and then to get to the next
step you have to provide some sort of password or other signature from a
security perspective with authentication there's there's really three major types
of authentication so there's something you know which is like a password you
know some random string some random alphanumeric characters or whatever
there's something you have and that would be something like a Yuba key you
piece of hardware you know you trezor actually I believe I believe trezor can
do you to f authentication for example and then finally there is something you
are and that's the biometrics and really if we're talking about high security
then you never want there to be only a single piece of authentication you want
there to be multiple factors of authentication because you should
operate under the assumption that any one thing is going to become compromised
so you know I haven't dug too much into like world coin itself for example I
know that they they seem to be using the biometrics as an anti-civil type of
mechanism I'm not aware that they're using them on a like regular basis like
as authentication to your wallet or transacting it could be wrong haven't
really looked into it but obviously even just the fact that they're collecting
biometrics in the first place is scary there's just so many things that could
go wrong there so I personally do not use biometrics for anything if I if I
did and what probably the most common form of what people are using is you're
probably using biometrics to unlock your phone it's just so convenient right to
have either your face unlock or your fingerprint unlock on your phone and I
don't do that I have a really long pin and I probably have to put that pin into
my phone dozens of times a day I don't really want to think about you know how
much time that ends up costing me but the reason that I do that is that I
assume that if someone is holding me under duress then they're going to be
able to unlock my phone with my biometrics and I don't want that to be a
possibility so there's actually it's and it's not just that I'm like I'm saying
I'm a badass because no one could torture me or anything there's actually
legal precedent at least in the United States where you know my big problem or
my I guess one of my bigger fears is just border crossings so you know
whenever I cross a border I power everything down make so all of my data
is encrypted at rest and that means that if I got detained for some reason
they're not going to be able to just power off my device and then you know
push my finger on the phone or put it up to my face and be able to unlock it
because there are there have been court cases that have basically shown that the
Fourth Amendment protections do not cover biometric unlocking but they do
cover password and pin based unlocking so you can not be coerced into handing
over a pin or a password to your devices at least in the United States but you
can be coerced into handing over your biometrics yeah on that point there was
recently a post by Jonas Schnelly Bitcoin core developer and his parting
words were that future developers should join anonymously and then he says this
is tricky to do so I suppose you're kind of existing in a similar vein that's as
those core depths where there's always in motivation for someone to harm you
let's say or put you under duress and try and get your secrets out so would you
maybe speak to anonymity and Bitcoin as something that should go together yeah
you know I've actually fantasized about a world in which every pull request and
every commit to Bitcoin repositories is done by anonymous randomized hash
github username basically or you know preferably even a more on a more
decentralized system than github but that's a whole other issue and I have a
really long post that I wrote a while ago entitled like who controls Bitcoin
core because there's a lot of fud around that because they're like half a dozen
people who have merge access to the repository and sometimes people try to
you know do gain theory out well what you know could one of them be compromised
and then the whole project gets compromised so on so forth and it would
certainly be better if you know all the the maintainers of these important
software repositories were not known identity so that they couldn't be
targeted but the problem I kept running into when I try to sort of game that out
is that at least amongst people who are committing code to open source projects
I mean reputation is a thing and if everyone was completely anonymous like
where I was thinking of like a system where even if you you wouldn't even have
a username you know it would be kind of like 4chan where like every time you
post it's it's a different randomized username that system I I'm skeptical
that could ever work because if there's if there's no reputation it's kind of
demotivating and also reputation does help people create shelling points and
shelling points are kind of important in open source projects but as for like
individual users it's I mean privacy operational security is important
because you know we've changed the model and the incentives are a lot higher for
attackers because these are better assets I'm I'm not gonna say however that
you know many people will achieve true anonymity it's a really really high bar
it's it's quite impressive that Satoshi has managed to remain anonymous so that
is I suppose Satoshi is a great optimistic example of the fact that it
can be done but I think we should also assume that Satoshi really really knew
what they were doing they seem to cover their tracks pretty well and that the
problem with privacy especially if you're trying to achieve perfect
anonymity is that you only have to make one mistake you know you have to retain
a perfect operational security at all times whereas an attacker who's trying
to pierce through the shields of privacy that you've erected they only have to
succeed one time so it's very imbalanced from that perspective and that's why
it's very very hard to achieve perfection but I don't think that's what
people should be trying for really anything is better than nothing
yeah I think that's a very fair direction to go is just try and secure
your your Bitcoin as good as possible and user tools are available there for
you we have another speaker here to ask some questions and if anyone else from
the audience wants to ask Jameson how long do you have maybe we have another
ten minutes for questions sounds good perfect so request to speak and Saurosh
if you would like to speak please go ahead oh yes my name's Sir Sharali I'm a
undergraduate student at the University of Arkansas computer science and with
self custody I was wondering what is the best or not the best but your personal
favorite I didn't catch it Jameson for yourself if you don't mind me asking
yeah well I mean I'm highly biased because I've spent the past three years
building my my company casa to do that I don't know probably didn't really touch
on it earlier but like I said I spent the first three years of my full-time
Bitcoin work building security in the enterprise setting and even after doing
that for three years and generally being considered one of the top Bitcoin
security experts I found my own cold storage set up to be really onerous and
I did touch on that earlier where I was talking about you're creating these like
very crypt encrypted file containers and your secret sharing the decryption
phrase and I would basically do that on an annual basis and update everything
and then have to you know go distribute the the data drives and keys to my
executors and it was onerous it would take me like a whole weekend to to set
it up and to test it you know and do this all on an air gapped machine at
least a machine that I thought was air gapped you know like I said you can't
perfectly prove that but um I figured if it takes me a whole weekend to do this
and I'm highly motivated to do this because the majority of my net worth is
in these private keys then how can I possibly assume that you know more
average mainstream people who aren't so incentivized who aren't so technical who
aren't living eating and reeling this stuff every day for a decade are gonna
do what I consider to be the best practices for all of this and so that's
why it was natural for me to do the slight pivot and try to take the best
practices take the multi-sig aspects of the protocol and build something that
was more user-friendly so so I guess that's the the long-winded way of saying
that you know CASA you know distributed multi-sig you don't have to use CASA you
know we just try to make it easier we're not doing anything completely novel and
reinventing the wheel we're using standards we're building on top of well
established hardware and software in the space we're just trying to make it
easier for people to create a multi-signature setup where the keys are
geographically distributed and you're storing those keys on a variety of
different manufacturer hardware and the whole point of all of this is is very
simple and that is to eliminate single points of failure so we look at like
every piece of the system and how it's architected and say okay well if this
thing blows up will it be catastrophic and if so then we need to add more
redundancy there so that's I guess the the short version is not not just one
key even even if you have you know one set of keys and you create multiple
backups of them then you start running into this rabbit hole of you know how
do you ensure all the backups are also secure against things like physical
attackers I think most people would say well you have to encrypt the backups or
you have to have some sort of other you know password or whatever to be able to
access those and so then the question is okay how do you back up the the password
or the encryption key to that and it can very easily turn into a more convoluted
rabbit hole to keep the whole system together so I I felt like just worrying
about the keys themselves and putting those keys on physical devices that
people can easily you know think of and visualize and keep track of that that
was a more straightforward way for people to do private key management
perfect I appreciate it and then a last thing is Casa hodl the physical device
y'all sell it as well or was the recommendation for physical key and
storage unit yeah so we very we very specifically do not manufacture our own
hardware devices because we don't want too much trust to be in Casa itself we
write the software but we use and we support a variety of different hardware
devices Trezor was the first device we supported they are really the OG of
hardware key management then we added ledger and then we added a cold card and
most recently we added keystone and we're gonna keep adding devices that we
believe will continue to improve the usability and the security of the whole
suite of software that we are offering to people appreciate it thank you yeah
if there's anyone else who wants to speak we still have another five minutes
so please do request otherwise we'll be wrapping up soon Jameson thanks a lot
for your time I think this has been really enlightening in in many ways so I
guess the key takeaways here are do what you can to secure your coins don't think
that anything is too little but continuously strive for more think about
your multiple both the attack vectors that you have within your life and maybe
personalize it to yourself and yeah I suppose we all just need to be a bit more
aware of the of this huge transitionary period so where people are not so
familiar with with with Bitcoin yet and are not used to the new levels of
security we need to start really hammering down those those veins in in
our society so Raymond Raymond's just joined us welcome to our talk I've seen
you here for a while please go ahead and speak as one of that quick question as
taproot approaches obviously you know taproot gets activated next month and
you're probably held up by you know support from all the harbor manufacturers
will you be adding taproot support to casa as soon as it's ready her quorum
setup like let's say if I have like you know two treasures or treasure in a
ledger as long as I've got those two could we do taproot support or you have
to work wait for all four of the hardware manufacturers plus your
internal services before taproot set casa yeah this is gonna be an
interesting thing to deal with in particular you know the fact that we
support a variety of different manufacturers hardware devices and they
may not all support the same thing at the same time that can definitely be a
gating function but with with taproot it's even trickier because I do not
expect that we're just going to go in and implement taproot where we're doing
multi-sig the you know creating the actual like multi-sig spending pass where
it still gets all exposed on Shane like I don't think we're as interested in
doing that as we are in waiting for there to be a clear winner when it comes
to signature aggregation and right now it seems like there's maybe three
different proposals for how to do that and I'm I haven't heard of like any of
the hardware manufacturers commenting on them or saying like we're gonna
implement this one so it's still very much in a holding pattern on how we do
that because the signature aggregation I would say is the most important thing
that we're interested in for our users because it will give them much greater
deal of on-chain privacy because you know under under the the right you know
optimal happy conditions it's no longer even gonna look like a multi-sig spend
on Shane and unfortunately you know with the nature of Bitcoin development it's
hard for me to say when everything is gonna fall into place for us to be able
to support that cool I didn't expect like a full-blown date but I just know
with the collaborative capacity of like a very unique challenge getting
everything ready compared to every other wallet manufacturer so appreciate it it
is though you know there's always gonna be workarounds for example if you had a
key set where all but one of your devices supported some new functionality
then you can either in CASA you can either rotate that key out which of
course requires sweeping the funds of the wallet or if you have that seed
phrase you can always just load it onto a different manufacturer device that
does support the functionality yeah that's good point thanks
okay and we have one more question please RMB feel free okay it's just
dropped off I suppose we don't really have a queue here so I guess most of the
questions have been answered which is great I again thank you very much
Jameson for joining if you have any parting words maybe please feel free to
go ahead yeah I guess the main thing is we've talked about a lot of things I
think it's pretty clear is very complex space just don't be overwhelmed you know
you don't have to be an expert and spend all day every day worrying about this
stuff just take it one little bit at a time
yeah I guess everyone's been through ups and downs of a different portions and
yeah it can be it can be overwhelming but time goes on number goes up and we
we get over it I suppose just need to look out for yourself so thanks everyone
for joining us I'm going to end this now and thanks a lot again for Jameson and
all of our speakers and all the questions and this is the last space
that we've been running for cyber security month we'll be putting out a
recording of this as well and the other two that we had earlier the previous two
weeks so if you missed the earlier parts of the of the of the session or you can
always catch up with it there it will be on YouTube within about a week so again
thanks for joining and yeah good night to everyone or a good morning good day
etc
so Jameson as well you might want to say goodbye all right thanks for listening
bye

Hello and welcome to Epicenter.
My name is Brian Palin Crane.
And my name is Sebastian Couture.
So before we get started with the episode, I just wanted to mention something briefly.
There is this online conference called Decentralized Summit, it's organized by Mainframe and that's
taking place on the 29th and the 30th, so January 29th and 30th.
And I'm going to give a talk there, so if you're interested in that, check it out.
So that's DecentralizedSummit.com, spoke a little bit about Proof of Stake and CourseOne
and Cosmos.
So yeah, if you want to check it out, that's there.
There's also a bunch of other interesting speakers including, you know, former Epicenter
guests like Vinay Gupta, Kyle Samani, Arthur Falls.
So that's that there.
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
Yeah, so today our guest is Jameson Lopp.
If you are on Twitter and follow the crypto Twittersphere, you are probably familiar with
this character.
And so we talked a lot about his early days in Bitcoin, how he got involved in Bitcoin,
sort of political views with regards to volunteerism or anarchy, as others like to call it.
We also went in depth about his writing because he's quite a prolific writer and writes about
Bitcoin and also operational security.
So we talked quite a bit about his operational security and the lengths to which he goes
to protect himself and his privacy and sort of his data in general.
So it was a really great interview.
We hope you will enjoy it.
And if this sort of strikes a chord with you, if you think that operational security is
something that's important to you, why don't you let us know on Twitter what you think
or things that you might implement or best practices that you might implement in your
own personal life to protect your operational security and protect your privacy online.
So here's our interview with Jameson Lopp.
We're here today with Jameson Lopp.
Jameson is the CTO of a company called Casa.
They provide kind of a very high-end, high-quality key storage solution.
We're going to speak about that later a bit.
They also have a Bitcoin lightning node.
He was previously at Bitgo, so he was an early engineer at Bitgo, which of course has been
providing also Bitcoin vault and storage custody solutions.
And he's very well known for his writing.
So he's an excellent writer.
And I was actually just on a long plane ride over the weekend and I read all of your blog
posts on Medium.
So there's really a lot of fantastic in-depth Medium posts about Bitcoin, Bitcoin development,
security aspects, but also some things like operational security and some of the crazy
things that Jameson goes through to make sure his operational security is top-notch.
So thanks so much for joining us today, Jameson.
Pleasure to be here.
Thanks for having me.
I'm curious to start off.
And often we ask that question, but it's always interesting to kind of hear the story of how
people originally became involved in Bitcoin, learned about it, and sort of found their
way in.
Yeah.
So I unfortunately do not remember the first time that I heard about Bitcoin.
I'm sure that I heard about it several times and dismissed it several times as some new
system that was going to get hacked and everybody was going to lose their money.
But at some point it kept coming back.
I kept reading about it on Slashdot and other tech sites.
And I decided to look into it because it was not going away.
And once I read the white paper, I realized that it was actually a fairly elegant computer
science solution.
And that's what really caught my interest and made me start wanting to dig into it more
and really understand how it worked.
And I was just fortunate at the time that I was working at this online marketing agency
doing a lot of heavy lifting on the back end with the data analysis and whatnot.
And I talked to the guy who was sitting in the cubicle next to me and I was like, hey,
you know about this Bitcoin thing?
And he's like, oh yeah, man, I've been writing bots to do automated arbitrage trading on
exchanges between various cryptocurrencies and paid off my mortgage from doing that.
And I was like, why didn't you tell me about any of this?
But thankfully, he was able to answer a lot of my really basic questions about it.
And then within a fairly short time period, I had surpassed even what he knew about it
and kept diving down the rabbit hole and eventually created my own fork of the Bitcoin software
to get more analytics and data out of it.
And ultimately started a few meetup groups and after a few years, there was enough venture
capital in the space that I was able to go full time.
And so now I've been doing Bitcoin engineering for a good four years now.
And so what was it about Bitcoin that when you heard about it was like, okay, this is
something interesting.
And what were kind of your political and philosophical views pre-Bitcoin?
Yeah, I mean, I had never really thought about money and economics that much other than,
you know, I took like an econ 101 class at university.
But once I started looking into how it actually worked and the idea that you can actually
represent money just with pure software and do it in a way that nobody controlled it,
I realized that, you know, this is a very powerful concept and it makes sense to me
because I feel like money is this abstract idea that it doesn't belong to anyone.
It belongs to humanity at large.
And it makes sense for something like this to be an open collaborative project.
And the idea that we can actually make it an open source collaborative project was very
intriguing to me and really appealed, I guess, to some of my anti-government sentiments.
And so from a political standpoint, I had been all over the spectrum, was raised in
a very conservative household and ended up going to a very liberal university.
And so, you know, throughout my voting career, I voted conservative and then liberal.
And then after realizing that like none of those parties were actually like fulfilling
their promises or seem to be improving my life in any way, started going more towards
the libertarian route.
And it was once I got into Bitcoin and then started reading the history of the cypherpunks
and the cryptoanarchist movement that spawned out of that, that really just pushed me even
further down the libertarian thought process.
In that vein, you did this interview with Crypto 101, which is a blog post that we'll
link to in the show notes where you just said that you want to strive, that you strive to
bring cryptoanarchy to the world.
What does that mean exactly to you to bring cryptoanarchy to the world?
So you know, the word anarchy can definitely trigger a lot of people, especially because
governments use the word anarchy as a bad word, and they try to make it seem like anarchy
is equivalent to chaos and violence and destruction and whatnot.
But you know, a less triggering word would probably be volunteerism, or just the idea
of having voluntary interactions with people.
So if we're approaching it from the standpoint of we want to build a society where everyone
is interacting with each other voluntarily, rather than due to threats of force or coercion
from this overarching entity, such as a government, then the way that we get there is we look
at all the different services that governments are providing and we ask ourselves, you know,
how can you privatize these services, how can you offer them in a way that is voluntary?
So that, you know, if, if I want to have my roads that I'm driving down, somebody needs
to pay for them.
Well, maybe the people who are using them should be paying for them.
And right now, it makes sense that a lot of these services that we're paying for are done
through taxes, because it's just an easier way to coordinate paying for things and actually,
you know, paying for what you're using.
But you know, as the technology continues to improve, then we should be able to automate
a lot of these interactions and be able to have, you know, micro transactions, as we're,
you know, going down the road or as we're using a service that is out there, where basically
we need to decrease the cognitive load that is required to perform those interactions.
So the government is basically stepping in and managing a lot of that stuff so that we
don't think about it.
We just have a lot of money taken out of our paychecks, and then the government deals with
all the coordination.
So if we can reproduce the coordination with software, preferably software that is smart
enough to, you know, understand you as a user and what you want, then that's when we can
actually start to conceive of replacing some of these coordination mechanisms that the
government is doing with actual software mechanisms.
And you know, this is a very like long term view.
I don't think it's going to happen even in the next few years.
But it seems to me that as we are continuing to build software that is getting better at
performing these actions, then, you know, we're at least headed in the right direction.
So how do you see that actually playing out?
Because I grew with you on a high level, right?
If you look at something like roads, then okay, you have this coordination problem and
taxes kind of make sense, right?
But then maybe a lot of other things you could say, okay, actually, you could easily replace
it with sort of market based mechanisms.
But did you, is the path you see here, do you think because of these increased technological
possibilities, you know, let's say if you take like the US government, they would increasingly
move in a direction like that and say, okay, we privatize and we have these kind of voluntary
mechanisms instead of tax driven or do you think what's going to happen is that, you
know, the fiat system is going to collapse and, you know, in its ashes, you will have
the rise of these new, more anarchist structures or like, what's the path you see?
I certainly don't think it's gonna all happen at once that there, you know, will be these
gradual evolutions and it certainly seems less likely that it's going to be a major
collapse of like United States or Europe or whatever.
But rather, what I think is more interesting is watching some of the smaller countries
or the more mismanaged countries and as they collapse, you know, those could be test beds
that are rife for adoption of technology like this.
So I know a lot of people talk about like Venezuela and their hyperinflation and how
Bitcoin could help people in that situation potentially a lot more than those of us who
are fairly comfortable in first world countries.
The same thing may be true for any other types of services and technologies that can replace
various like government functions.
How is it going to happen?
I mean, that's kind of where you have to wave your hands and say, well, if we believe in
the free market, then entrepreneurs are going to come in and, you know, find opportunities
where a government is not doing a good job providing services and basically offer these
new high-tech versions for people.
And that's where adoption would have to happen, I think, of places where the new methodology
for coordinating stuff is superior to what is already in place with governments.
So, you know, if that happens and is successful over a long term, then perhaps the technology
technologies will evolve to a point that they can provide even better services than first
world countries.
Not to get into any political discussions about the current state of the U.S. government,
but what does the current government shutdown, I believe it's still going on, tell you about
the possibility or impossibility of this to happen?
Yeah, well, the U.S. government shutdown, I think, ended a couple of days ago, but it's
only a temporary suspension.
They're funding the government for another three weeks and then it might shut down again.
And you know, I think it's interesting to see, at least in the United States, we continue
to polarize politics more and more, I think, at least in part due to the result of media
and communications technology, and that has, it seems to me, resulted in even greater levels
of gridlock so that it's even more and more difficult to actually get things done from
a political sense and that it seems like these nation states are kind of floundering in what
they can do.
So that could provide, you know, more opportunity for these other types of technologies to step
in.
But I don't know, I don't even really participate in politics anymore.
I don't vote both for operational security reasons and because I think it's a waste of
my time.
I mean, I think that it's a better use of my own resources to focus on these systems
that I hope over the long term can replace a lot of the functions of the government.
Well, if it's any lesson, I think Belgium didn't have a government for, what, like,
two years or maybe more at some point in the early 2010s.
And there were, I don't think there were very many sort of voluntary or anarchic style systems
to emerge from that.
I mean, I was living right on the border of Belgium at that time, it didn't seem like
that was going on there.
Maybe that's because they were too busy drinking beer and having French fries or Belgian fries
for that matter.
So since you became involved in Bitcoin, did you have any periods of doubt where, you know,
you were doubtful about the future of the project and if so, in what way?
Sure.
I mean, we've been through a number of hype cycles and FUD cycles and, you know, Bitcoin
is going to die for this reason or that reason.
The greatest doubts were probably in the early days of the scaling debate when it seemed
like we had a great opportunity in front of us to just increase block sizes and allow
more throughput on the network, allow more use cases and whatnot.
And there were times when I thought that, you know, there were some pretty big groundswells
of support for that.
And, you know, we were looking at statistics like, you know, mining hash rate and stuff
and it looked like, oh, it's, you know, it's sure to go through.
And then, you know, there were a number of surprises along the way that basically showed
that, you know, statistics are not necessarily indicative of what is going to happen.
And there were also, you know, the whole censorship and moderation debate, the thing has got fairly
nasty there.
I mean, I even, I think I had some posts and comments and stuff that got removed from Reddit
and pissed me off and I went and became a moderator of the Bitcoin XT subreddit because
we were the censorship free subreddit.
But you know, after moderating that for six or 12 months, I gave it up because it became
clear to me that unmoderated forums are pretty terrible places and you don't really get a
whole lot of signal through the noise.
But I never lost enough hope that I wanted to stop working on the project.
You know, this all happened basically after I had gone full time and was working at BitGo.
You know, even within BitGo, we had a number of arguments about like where the direction
of Bitcoin was going to go and what different people wanted to see out of it.
But ultimately, you know, even though there was a lot of frustration and periods of doubt,
I got to the point where I basically figured that, you know, so many people are spending
so much time and resources arguing about what's going to happen to the system, then it's probably
not an indication that it's going to fail.
It's actually an indication that there are a lot of people who are dedicated to maintaining
and improving the system.
And we just have slightly different beliefs about like what the best way to go about that
is and what the tradeoffs are that we're willing to make.
But ultimately, out of that many years of debate, my conclusion was that Bitcoin can't
actually die unless we all agree that it's dead, unless we agree that we no longer want
to work on it and try to improve it.
And so that's why I think that really the biggest threat to Bitcoin is just apathy.
It's not, you know, 51% attacks or nation-states and regulations or any of the other million
reasons that you'll find people who have written articles about why Bitcoin is going to die
this time.
Really, I think Bitcoin can only die if it becomes super boring and nobody wants to work
on it anymore.
And so you think it's not, let's say 51% attack, nation-states 51% attack, because you think
if people still care about Bitcoin, then they'll, I don't know, hard fork to a different proof
of work or something like that, or?
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, ultimately, any technical failure or bug or anything that gets exploited at
a technical level, if that causes the system to cease to be functional and operational,
then that means that we have to fall back to the foundation, which is human consensus.
So all of the stuff, the code, the protocol, the network, the hardware that's running nodes
and miners and whatnot, all of that stuff is really just running machine consensus.
And machine consensus is just our best guess, our best representation at trying to turn
human consensus into code.
But this is what I think the ultimate challenge is, is figuring out what the human consensus
is for what Bitcoin should be.
And that starts to get more philosophical and go down the path that I went into great
depth of with my article that I entitled Nobody Understands Bitcoin, where I was really just
trying to describe this vague concept that is floating out there of what Bitcoin is and
how developers and other people in the ecosystem who spend a lot of time talking about Bitcoin,
they're kind of like poking at that, they're trying to read the shape of what this actual
consensus for Bitcoin is, but nobody can actually completely grab it because it is dispersed
amongst all of the people who are participating in the system.
Let's say we think that 10 years ahead, where would you like to see Bitcoin and what would
you like it to be?
Because I mean, I think you correctly point out that there's these different conceptions.
If you read the white paper, it talks about electronic cash.
In recent years, this idea of digital gold has become more prevalent.
Maybe some people like the idea that it will be some sort of basis for trustless computing
and maybe those kind of things, even though now they probably get built more in Ethereum
or other networks, maybe in the future, Bitcoin could also be that or like payment, there's
so many different things.
What is your thing you'd most like to see Bitcoin evolve into?
I think that I summed up a lot of that in another article I wrote about Bitcoin being
this trust anchor.
I am a technologist and ultimately I see Bitcoin and then the blockchain that's underneath
it as a new type of database.
We just happen to have a new set of rules and protocol around how that database gets
replicated and how we append new data to the database.
From that standpoint, I do think that there is more to it than just money.
I think that what we're trying to do is create this global record of truth or at least authoritative
record that has no authority behind it.
You can definitely expend more resources to building on top of it than just for money
and finance.
Basically any data that you want to become part of this authoritative record, you can
put it in there.
The question just becomes if you're moving beyond the simple accounting ledger that the
Bitcoin protocol supplies, you have to basically create your own protocol, your own new consensus
for whatever that extension is.
Whether that is some sort of layer two network or a side chain that is pegged to Bitcoin
or extension blocks or whatever, there's potentially limitless number of ways to do this.
It's really limited by our own creativity, imagination, technical engineering skills
and our ability to convince other people to actually agree with us to use whatever we
build on top of it is.
From that standpoint, I do think that more complex systems, smart contract type stuff,
better privacy is definitely possible by anchoring into Bitcoin and not necessarily having to
change the Bitcoin protocol itself.
I want to see a lot of people continue to experiment with this.
What is the most recent one?
I guess VeraBlock is an interesting new one where they're anchoring a lot of stuff into
the Bitcoin blockchain to make use of the proof of work.
It's not quite clear to me how many different systems might get built on top of that, but
it is this blossoming of experimentation and a lot of them will fail.
Eventually any type of system that is being built on the internet and is meant to be some
sort of global system with a data state that is backing whatever you're doing interacting
with that system, it could potentially benefit from using Bitcoin as an anchoring mechanism.
It's really broad, really general, even if we're looking at smart contracting systems
like Ethereum or EOS or whatnot.
I think a good example is actually like RSK where they're kind of blending.
They're taking that smart contracting language from Ethereum and they've created this side
chain that is pegged to Bitcoin so you can kind of have the best of both worlds.
Whether or not that ends up being highly adopted, nobody knows, but that's the type of experimentation
that I like to see and just want to continue to see more systems get secured by these global
consensus mechanisms because it's going to make them more robust against various types
of attacks.
Are you kind of like Bitcoin maximalist in this regard that you think Bitcoin is the
correct foundation for this as opposed to having maybe other chains or proof of stake?
Right now, for the most part, maybe you can build some sort of smart contract thing on
Bitcoin, but hardly anybody does it.
This is like 99% of the activity is on Ethereum or other types of new chains.
Do you think those will migrate more towards building on Bitcoin?
It's going to require a number of things.
I think that there are people in the Bitcoin ecosystem who are interested in smart contracts
and they simply don't like the way that Ethereum went about doing it.
There's this big clash between the idea of execution versus verification and so a lot
of the more conservative Bitcoin developers don't like having smart contracts that have
to get executed by everyone on the network.
They rather want to perform the same type of logic, but where the actual execution happens
privately and then you're just providing a proof of the execution that the rest of the
world can verify.
So from that standpoint, we are seeing stuff like Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees and
Taproot and the Simplicity smart contracting language, which I would argue those are the
things that some of these Bitcoin developers who are interested in smart contracts are
trying to build their Bitcoin version of more expressive smart contracts.
Now, how long is it going to take before that becomes a thing that is as easy for a newbie
developer to use as like Solidity or Viper or whatever on Ethereum is once again up in
the air.
It seems like the space of advancements with the Bitcoin base protocol is a lot more measured
and slower than a lot of other chains for a number of reasons, but I generally call
it like conservatism or you could even think of it as like almost like aerospace engineering
level of thinking through all the edge cases and testing stuff and not wanting to deploy
anything unless everybody's close to 100% confident about it.
But would you say that perhaps this conservatism and this time that it may take for these platforms
to emerge and become stable might cause a situation where people build applications
on Ethereum because it's easy and you have sort of a concentration of developers there
and people already building on those systems and where it just becomes the switching cost,
it just becomes way too high and where interactions between the two systems just don't exist
or are complicated where in the end it might not come to fruition that Bitcoin would become
this system where one can build complex applications.
I don't know about switching costs, but it's really more of like a network effect growth.
I think the argument for creating almost any alternative system to Bitcoin is that you
have a lot more flexibility in what you can do and changes and evolve it.
So you potentially have a better chance of growing faster than Bitcoin exceeding its
network effects and becoming the dominant system or what have you.
That seems to be basically true for almost any crypto asset network out there is that
it's usually because some set of people or developers wants to do some things that were
pretty clearly not going to get accepted into the Bitcoin based protocol and they would
feel like it would be easier for them to create their own new consensus around a shared set
of objectives and roadmap and what have you.
That's why competition is great.
I think one of the big pushbacks to the maximalism thought is I see a lot of people saying, well,
you're maximalism is pushing for like a monoculture and I think that that's kind of a misunderstanding
of at least what most Bitcoin maximalists think.
I don't think any of them are diluted to the point that they don't think that other systems
will exist.
I think that it's more about looking at the ways that network effects evolve and first
mover advantages, the value of networks and how they are distributed where generally the
vast majority of value between competing networks will go to one network and then the other
networks will just be a lot smaller.
But these tend to be I think more economic type of thoughts of how these types of systems
tend to play out rather than a blind belief that Bitcoin was first and it must be the
best and will never be superseded, yada, yada, yada.
There's definitely plenty of potential for other systems to get greater adoption and
surpass Bitcoin or somehow be order of magnitude more utilitarian than Bitcoin is and therefore
supersede its network effects.
I don't think that anything is set in stone for sure.
There's going to be a lot of competition for the foreseeable future.
This episode of Epicenter is brought to you by Microsoft and the Azure Blockchain Workbench.
Getting your blockchain from the whiteboard to production can be a big undertaking and
something as simple as connecting your blockchain to IoT devices or existing ERP systems is
a project in itself.
Well, the folks at Microsoft have you covered.
You already know about the Azure Blockchain Workbench and how easy it makes bootstrapping
your blockchain network pre-configured with all the cloud services you need for your enterprise
app.
Their new development kit is the IFTTT for blockchains.
Suppose you want to collect data from someone in a remote location via SMS and half that
data packaged in a transaction for your hyperledger fabric blockchain.
The development kit allows you to build this integration in just a few steps in a simple
drag and drop interface.
Here's another great example.
Perhaps you're an institution working with Ethereum and rely on CSV files sent by email.
One click in the dev kit and you can parse these files and have the data embedded in
transactions.
Whatever you're working with, the dev kit can read, transform, and act on the data.
To learn more and to build your first application in less than 30 minutes, visit aka.ms slash
epicenter and be sure to follow them on Twitter at MSFT blockchain.
We'd like to thank Microsoft and Azure for their support of Epicenter.
You wrote this great post on Medium looking at Bitcoin in 2018 and sort of drawing the
picture of what unfolded over the year and in that post were a lot of really in-depth
statistics on everything from transaction volume to number of times Bitcoin has been
declared dead over the years.
So I really encourage people to look at that post.
We'll have it on our show notes.
What stands out most for you in 2018?
What were the sort of flagship things that we can look at as standing out for this past
year?
Well, I think the biggest thing that also surprised a lot of people was the growth of
the Lightning Network and how quickly people were adopting it despite it still being fairly
risky to do so.
This is even true with my own company and the Lightning nodes that we've been shipping
out there.
There are still plenty of unresolved issues from a security and usability standpoints
where the Lightning Network still has years worth of development ahead of it before I
think it will become something that is capable of really being a mainstream payment network.
But nevertheless, the enthusiasm for that probably at least partially after years of
stalemate with the scaling debate and people being excited about actually having something
new to do, a lot of people have just been plugging in and experimenting with it and
as a result finding issues, breaking things, which is how it evolves.
We push the envelope, we find problems, and then we fix them.
This has certainly been my experience over the past year with learning more about Lightning
Network and having some close calls with losing money and blowing up my nodes and stuff.
It's actually the basis for one of my newest talks that I've been going around which is
basically entitled The Bitcoin Decade and Failing Forward.
Once again looking at the history of this space, there have been innumerable failures
over the years and actually I think like Andreas Antonopoulos did a really good talk a few
years ago, it was his Bubble Boy and Sewer Rat talk where he talked about how these anti-fragile
networks continue to evolve over time.
The internet itself is a similar type of story and that's why I think once again that apathy
is what is going to kill this thing.
As long as people are still interested in it, they're still putting their time and resources
into using it and experimenting, building, and breaking, that's how the technology continues
to improve and that's how we slowly but surely get to that next tier and then the next tier
and the next tier of adoption.
I remember we did podcasts 2015 I think, or maybe it was beginning of 2016 and it was
like okay Lightning is four months away and it's going to be used and now it's taking
much longer.
I think last year there was a significant amount of activity but at the same time it
seems all like the kind of activity you were talking about.
People are saying oh this is cool, I want to try it out, play with it, test it but it's
not really people using it yet for commerce, the mainstream wallets haven't adopted it.
So do you feel like this is just an inevitable thing and it's going to take some time but
it's going to happen or do you still see major risks and a big probability that maybe Lightning
Network is actually never going to reach the point where it's going to be mainstream capable?
Well it currently seems to be the inevitable path because that's what a lot of people are
focusing on.
With regards to the capability of going mainstream I would say that there are still a lot of
questions out there, there are things that need to be built and improved upon but I would
say that one of the biggest open questions is mostly going to be around liquidity management.
Not necessarily the technical side of the network but the financial side of how do we
build tools that make it easy for people to manage the liquidity on the network and specifically
manage the balance of the channels on the network.
I think that the first article that I wrote about Lightning Network was around early 2015
and that was really one of the biggest problems that I was talking about back then as well
is trying to model what the economic issues are going to be with the network and as we've
had a lot more people actually experimenting and building out the real networks now we're
actually getting data where we can better understand how this new network works and
so from a protocol standpoint that's where things like the autopilot functionality that
the L&D devs are working on is important.
The autopilot functionality that exists right now is not great.
A human who is being careful about their channel management can do a lot better than what the
autopilot is doing but this is one of the things where we need more data in order to
figure out what the best way of managing the channels is and that's just like at a micro
level then the next question becomes what are the macro economic issues and I also talked
about a few of those problems in my article but one of my conclusions was that in order
for liquidity at a macro scale on the network to be more sustainable I think it'll be extremely
important that we have exchanges that get tied into the Lightning Network so that you
can basically rebalance channels easily sort of without a band payments through exchanges.
So lots of open questions for sure that is there's a lot of work ahead of us.
I think that at least from a general standpoint that you know this type of layered protocol
engineering does make sense it's the same way that the internet itself was scaled with
various layers of technologies so I certainly don't believe any of the FUD that people are
putting out there of saying that it results in like inherent centralization and fractional
reserve banking and all this other stuff but that's not to say we're doing something that
has never really been done before so you're going to come down to I think the level of
dedication that people are going to put into trying to solve the hard problems.
We also wrote this post recently about who controls Bitcoin and in it you describe the
history of Bitcoin core development and who has maintained the repos over the years and
also describe the different layers of security and the different layers of decentralization
all the way from you know when someone issues a pull request to a fork being adopted or
something of that nature you know it was a great post also I want to mention so why did
you want to write about this why did you feel it was important for you to write about this?
Yeah I would say probably the majority of the long-form blog posts that I write are
fairly self-serving because I tend to write about things after I have received a question
numerous times and I find myself repeating myself basically of trying to explain a complex
topic and so then a lot of times I'll just say you know what I'm going to write it once
really really well and then in the future I just send that link you know whenever somebody
asks the question so this question of like does Bitcoin core as a group control the protocol
itself of Bitcoin is something that has been coming up at least ever since the scaling
debate started and we started seeing alternative Bitcoin implementations that were created
specifically for the purpose of forking away from Bitcoin core in their process and it's
very difficult to convince people of because of what a complex process it is though if
I had to sum it all up you know it basically comes down to the fact that Bitcoin core can't
force anybody to run their software but even behind the scenes there are so many other
security considerations and processes in place to ensure the integrity of the code just to
you know try to minimize the trust within Bitcoin core itself as an organization that
you know we want it to be as verifiable as possible and as difficult as possible for
anyone to inject bad code in there ultimately you know this doesn't address I guess governance
issues of you know well what if I have an idea that will make Bitcoin so much greater
and the Bitcoin core development process rejects it you know that is ultimately going to come
down to the way that any open source software works which is you know you have voice and
exit as your two main options and if you can't voice your opinion to the point that you can
convince others to change the software repository that is being used by most people then you
have to fork your own and try to build you know new level of human consensus around that
but the main thing that I guess I was trying to get at is that you know Bitcoin core is
just a name the fact that it happens to use this specific GitHub repository is also not
that particularly important once again it comes down to this kind of vague hand wavy
concepts of early we were talking about well what is Bitcoin what is the human consensus
for Bitcoin it's something that's out there you know in the ether and we're all trying
to understand what it is so that we can turn it into code and it's kind of the same thing
for the main reference implementation for that code this sort of focal point of development
there is no authority that forces the focal point to be in one GitHub repository or forces
it to be managed by certain people that that focal point has changed names over the years
it has changed platforms of where the repository is over the years and it can there's nothing
really preventing it from changing again if the human consensus occurs to change it and
you know there's plenty of reasons why that might happen and you know this is once again
this sort of the voluntary interactions of this anarchic system can be very frustrating
to people who like to have you know hard and fast decisions made about things and when
we get into like stalemate situations where the default in these systems is is basically
no or veto you know if if people don't make a conscious effort then usually the default
is no action that's when people get really frustrated and that's when drama happens or
people start forking off and trying to build new consensus and that ultimately I think
that is the way that the governance of these systems is meant to work it's just a completely
new model that people are not very familiar with and can can result in frustration and
people getting upset I really like this notion of focal point that used quite a bit in the
article and I think one thing that this article a few things that I learned from this article
one it kind of opened my mind to this this idea that these focal points exist in just
about every form of organization in our society and and the other also is that well I kind
of realized that Bitcoin is a lot less centralized than I thought it was previously it feels
much more decentralized now that I sort of understand the different layers and fail safes
that are in place in order to protect you know the repository but also the network I
mean committing to the GitHub repo ultimately doesn't doesn't signal very much in terms
of the direction of the network so I encourage people to read the post in detail compared
to other GitHub repositories or other software repositories open source software projects
does Bitcoin fall in the norm in terms of implementing all these fail safes and the
signatures and the verifications and whatnot or is this really an outlier I think that
it's an outlier you know I don't even have enough time to do that same level of research
on all of the other repositories but you know even you know I have looked at like some of
the other the forks of Bitcoin core and and their processes and I've you know some of
them at least do like you know GPG signed code commits but none of them seem to have
that same level of like automated infrastructure and integrity checks set up really what you
find with a lot of projects is that it's like one or two developers that pretty much control
everything and that's that's usually just due to the like lack of size and interest
in that particular project another particularly interesting thing that I find is like which
which node implementations have automatic update mechanisms built into them there's
actually something that I ran into recently where I was trying to update one of our parity
nodes and I downloaded the new binary for it and was checking the version from the RPC
output and for some reason the version wasn't changing and it took me like half an hour
to figure out that basically you know parity had this automatic update functionality and
it was you know under the hood even though I was running a different binary it was it
actually had some other binary on the back end that it was running in place you know
that that's just kind of like weird stuff where it makes sense for a lot of software
to automatically update you know that it decreases the cognitive load of the users of having
to to keep looking for updates on their own but it definitely changes the the security
model when you're you're trying to run this independent distributed network
so I am glad you you know we speak a bit about this process of like okay how bitcoin is is
updated and managed in this and I agree I was impressed just like how much thought and
levels of control and you know having automated tools to check you know all of the commits
ever made in the cryptographic signatures etc etc you know it's such a thorough thing
that has been built up over so many years and I recently heard this interview with some
investment advisor right and so he was asked about what do you think of bitcoin and he
was like well you know you have so many cryptocurrencies and you know blockchain is interesting but
you know the issue is it's open source and somebody can take it and you know they can
improve it and you know why would the first version have been the best why wouldn't somebody
be able to go and say hey I'm changing something on bitcoin now it's better and then if you
invest in bitcoin how would you ever be sure that not it's going to be replaced and of
course it could happen but I think there's also just points to there's so much infrastructure
that's been built and so much really such a level of quality and optimization and processes
and automation and checks and assurances and you're replicating that is so hard and not
just for the repository though what I think a lot of people don't realize is the magnitude
of the infrastructure across the entire ecosystem and this is something that I ran into when
I was at BitGo and you know we were running basically enterprise wallet API's that were
used by exchanges and payment processors and and other various merchants and you know once
once the like all of these bitcoin fork started happening and once like the real like explosion
of tokens and stuff happened in 2017 it created a huge engineering workload for anyone who
is working in this space because in order to add support for these things like even
if if we're talking about like forks that are very almost identical to bitcoin or if
we're talking about like erc20 tokens that are all very very similar the ability to add
support for new ones is it's a lot more than just a copy paste operation like you you have
this entire infrastructure stack that has to be replicated and then slightly modified
and then have all of your new alerts and all of your other management systems running on
that infrastructure stack and it's it's a lot more difficult to get this entire distributed
ecosystem with all of their own infrastructure to to basically spool up entirely new systems
to support you know whatever your new bitcoin 2.0 is it's uh it's it's it is that power
of network effects yeah and of course network effects bring us to an interesting question
because the other big cryptocurrency or kind of blockchain network that has you know strong
network effects of course is ethereum what is your stance on ethereum like what do you
think of it uh let's see i've i've written a few articles about it ethereum in particular
gave me a lot of of grief as an infrastructure engineer especially you know during the i
guess the crypto kitties period or whatever you want to call it you know during late 2017
the the the last big run-up where a lot of crypto networks were seeing high adoption
rates and and basically running into their own technical limitations of what they could
process on the network and you know as an infrastructure engineer at bitgo i was running
quite a few different nodes you know we were supporting bitcoin and bitcoin cash and bitcoin
gold and ethereum and several erc 20 tokens and ripple and probably a few other things
i don't even remember and during that period when when a lot of adoption was happening
i i found that it was the ethereum nodes and the ripple nodes that were having the the
biggest problems from an infrastructure standpoint the the bitcoin nodes never had any performance
issues with them but of course there were plenty of issues on the network at large just
due to like throughput capabilities and you know resulting downstream usability problems
for people that were trying to make transactions on these networks but um my my my main problems
with with ripple and ethereum was that the they were really really disc io intensive
compared to the bitcoin and its derivatives and if i had to speculate then i imagine at
least for ethereum that is because of all of the the state changes where you know when
you're executing all of these smart contracts it's having to go look up a lot of data and
do disk reads and from what i've seen the geth and probably also parity developers have
have made some pretty good progress since that time of you know reducing the disk io
requirements but um this is one of those things where these these networks they have to get
stress tested in order for you to find the the limits of what they're capable of doing
and then you know you you find the bottlenecks you try to fix the bottlenecks as much as
possible and then you continue forward until the system gets adopted to the level enough
that you find new bottlenecks and you know that's the way that that pretty much all of
these things are going to have to continue to evolve and i think that what a lot of people
are arguing about when they talk about like long-term adoption and technical capabilities
is that they're trying to argue about like foreseeing bottlenecks far in the future which
i don't think that's really possible bottlenecks are often surprises and it's generally hard
to predict them unless you're you know doing a lot of diligence of basically you know creating
your own networks and running a lot of stress tests on them which as far as i can tell there
aren't many people that are doing that these days maybe one one more question on on the
ethereum versus bitcoin side and where i think we have a big difference so we spoke a little
bit about the processes around bitcoin and those processes revolve a lot around bitcoin
core and you know bitcoin core is kind of very sophisticated in like making sure you
know changes are safe and of course in bitcoin right bitcoin core is this reference implementation
and all of the miners basically run bitcoin core or some kind of like you know basically
that software and now in ethereum we have a specification and then we have multiple
clients right so there's parity and geth that i think are the most popular ones and then
i think those are you know much less decentralized you know parity i think is you know basically
by parity the company you know and and i'm sure there's some external contributors but
you know probably not too many and then geth is mostly the ethereum foundation and you
know again they're probably external contributors but you know it's kind of so but then you
have some process where they have to coordinate you know and and kind of make sure that the
changes they make actually align and don't end up splitting the network so what do you
think are the kind of pros and cons of that approach versus bitcoins yeah there have been
some very interesting debates around you know specifications and you know what is the specification
for for bitcoin and people generally say well the specification is the code in the reference
implementation i don't fully agree with that either i mean i think that it gets you most
of the way there but then you know with ethereum actually having a written down specification
that that can certainly help and i know that there was at least one case probably a few
cases where one ethereum node implementation had a bug and you know when they went and
they looked at that implementation versus the other implementations it was pretty clear
that you know that implementation was not following the specification but i think ultimately
the question is you know what is the specification for any of these things and i kind of have
to fall back to my my hand wavy thing of like what is bitcoin or what is ethereum what is
any public permissionless protocol while you can definitely write down the rules of what
is in the code it does a pretty good job of allowing you to understand the machine specification
i still believe that it's not really possible to write down the human consensus for specification
ultimately i mean you can write you can write down whatever you want and you can go about
you know trying to find human consensus in a number of different ways but there's there's
no guarantee that you're going to get that right and you know unforeseen things can happen
you know i guess a kind of good example at least with ethereum you know they had the
dowell fork and i i don't recall but i you know i don't believe that like re-entrancy
or or whatnot was like a hard part of the specification there it really became more
of a philosophical question around you know specification of the code versus actual intent
of the code you know once we get away from this machine this cold-hearted machine specification
we start talking about human intent and you know what it is that we really want that's
when i think we get more towards this vague hand wavy notion that the the actual consensus
for what any of these public permissionless networks is is is just it's kind of out there
um and it's hard to actually formalize so tldr it can certainly help in a few situations
but i don't think that you can fully formalize any of these things because you know it's
it's it's what's up in here except it's distributed amongst thousands if not millions of people
you also wrote another blog post describing your i guess your operational security protocol
or process or whatever you want to call it and and this was something that really struck
a chord with me because it's something that i've been really trying to get a handle on
as well in my own personal life but the level at which you seem to have gone to to protect
your yourself your data and presumably your family is is at a level that i never would
have imagined someone could go to you really try to protect themselves while remaining
a public figure now without maybe spending a lot of time on why you decided to do this
which people can read about and that is probably because you were swatted in 2017 i believe
you know why did you feel that you needed to go to these lengths to to protect yourself
well the the biggest issue which i think i talk about near the beginning of my my very
long post of what i did the the biggest issue is that you don't know what might become an
issue it's you know in the the internet age now we have the ability to to easily reach
millions if not hundreds of millions if not billions of people with a single tweet for
example and there are a number of of examples out there where people have unintentionally
said something you know on social media that triggered a horde of people as a result and
within that horde of people there might be one or two imbalanced people or people who
have you know mental issues or they don't know where the line is and they're willing
to go to an extreme length to try to harm you in some way or at least to to make you
afraid and so i think that that's kind of what happened to me is i went from having
you know a thousand followers on twitter and most people not really caring what i said
to having you know close to 200,000 followers and now if if i say something that offends
someone or that you know might be against someone's financial interests because they
hold a certain crypto asset then they might feel compelled to try to do something to to
hurt me or to to make me afraid or you know in the case of the swatting they were trying
to extort me though they didn't do a very good job at the extortion so it's from my
perspective trying to like look at where i am now and then think well i should probably
be conservative and assume that it might get like an order of magnitude worse so i should
try to improve my security and privacy to the point that someone who might expend an
order of magnitude or more resources trying to find me or hurt me or whatever because
you can't put that protection in place retroactively or at least if you do you have to do what
i did and basically burn your old life and start all over and that's very difficult for
most people to do so it's it's a lot easier to have the the privacy and security up front
like way more than you think you need in case there is an attacker because you know if an
attacker succeeds then the consequences are probably going to be you know more devastating
than whatever resources you put into the defenses up front if you're trying to be proactive
about it what do you think are the trade-offs of having such rigid operational security
because i mean i've implemented a few things in my life one of the things is i'm working
to get off google completely and off most social networks and you know the trade-offs
are that you know once in a while i need to do a little bit of more searching you know
to find like the closest restaurant that i'm looking for or something like that but in
your case this seems to be a lot more it seems to be a lot more of a burden or at least i
would assume how have you found it's impacted your life yeah i mean the the trade-offs
mostly occur when it comes to like physical real world interactions of stuff so on the
extreme case no one in my like physical proximity or no one that i interact with physically
where i am now actually knows who i am they don't know my real name they don't know what
i do they just know that i'm a programmer i'm a boring old programmer we don't have
to talk too much about you know what i'm actually doing because you don't want to hear it and
so you know that that can affect you know your like real world social life basically
is that i consider most of my my real friends that i share interests with are on the internet
or you know they're remote there i no longer have friends with shared interests who are
like in my physical location i do have friends you know that i've made that you know we can
do things together and and have fun activities and play games and you know entertain ourselves
and whatnot but it's not not in the you know crypto or privacy sphere of shared interest
so it's it's kind of like living a double life almost and sometimes that feels kind
of like you know james bond spy type stuff and other times it's just plain annoying you
know having to like drive around like to if i want to pick up my my mail i have to drive
fairly far to go to a private mailbox if i want to do anything that like requires a membership
where they're going to id me or whatever then i'm probably going to have to drive pretty
far because i i don't want you know my name and any databases that are tied to a location
so it can definitely be inconvenient in quite a few different ways but on the other hand
thankfully there are a lot of services out there these days that allow you to to sign
up uh pseudonymously so that has been helpful for a few things but um for the ones for the
things that don't um that is where it's become a lot more expensive and um you know hiding
my real identity will tend to like involve lawyers who charge me a lot of money to basically
act as a proxy on my behalf wow that's pretty mind-blowing so like actually like let's say
your neighbors and stuff like that they don't know your real name they know but i mean that
seems to be tricky especially with your you know pretty big public profile i mean the
chance that somebody i don't know listens to this podcast or sees you on twitter or
something and then it was like hey isn't that the guy that you know i have this other name
for like that seems like a high risk no well i guess i'm not actually a celebrity uh you
know i've only ever been recognized out in public one time and i think that that was
mostly due to the the beard i had at the time but other than that most of the time when
i'm out and about i i keep it pretty low key and i just you know look like another guy
so uh you know if i ever got to like real celebrity status level then hopefully that
would mean like bitcoin has done so well that i can buy my private island or something i
had this conversation with someone over the weekend where we're talking about privacy
not so much personal opsec but more on the privacy side and you know at the beginning
of your blog post you say uh some of the effects of you know most people would look at this
and say well i have nothing to hide or i'm not you know such a high profile person why
would someone want to attack me or steal my identity and people often say this to me and
and i'm not really quite sure what to respond i guess one of the things is of course you
know we don't really know what artificial intelligence and this sort of thing can could
you know is capable of in the future with the data that has accumulated on you what
do you normally tell people what's your sort of way to convince people that having good
operational security you know keeping your privacy matters sort of like under wraps and
also being careful about like your data and what you share with whom and what companies
what's your what's your way to convince people i guess so that's a good idea yeah yeah uh
so it's like i said it's kind of like the um spoonful of of proactive measures is worth
a um uh i guess a pound of of of trying to fix things up um it's because we know there
are a few things that we know um one of those is that information wants to be free and um
basically any any service that you give your data to over a long enough period of time
it's almost inevitable that that data is going to leak it might leak due to you know what
we've seen with facebook of like partnerships and accidentally allowing partners to see
data and and then those partners might leak it in other ways or it might leak because
they get exploited somehow and someone managed to manage to get like a big data dump and
put it for sale out on the darknet but um that's uh the first thing that i try to tell
people you know um at the very least you might want to worry about identity theft because
that's so common at least in the united states but then you know from more of the like actual
physical security and and operational side of things uh you don't know who you might
piss off and uh especially if you're active on social media um it's just not possible
to fully comprehend like the thought processes of everybody else out there who's on the internet
who might read or hear something that you say and then what they might do as a result
and so i believe that the vast majority of people are you know quote unquote good moral
people you know who will not harm others to help themselves in most situations but it's
pretty clear that there are a small number of people out there who have you know sociopathic
tendencies or who will do things that we generally consider to be immoral and and that's
that's you know what i'm worried about and and and for me that's because my audience
size and my reach has grown to the point that there are a non-negligible number of those
people who are likely to come across what i'm saying and you know get triggered by it
but um while while the likelihood of something like that happening for the average person
is probably lower uh you never know and so it's just like a it's a form of insurance
against a somewhat unlikely but still possible event that uh it's uh it's like the justine
sacco lady that i had in my post where uh you know she made one bad tweet and as a result
it uh it impacted her career and her life and uh you know her reputation is basically
ruined at this point yeah i think this this fear of escalation is is very is a very kind
of us-centric type of idea where like i think in the u.s. people will protect will want
to protect themselves in part because of this fear of escalation whereas in europe people
would want to protect themselves more as a preventative measure against you know companies
that might misuse their data or data leaks or this sort of thing like i feel like if
if i think here in in europe at least like fear of escalation is quite low i don't think
people will have much of a fear that like you know they might say something on twitter
that will piss someone off to the extent that they might might get physically harmed or
threatened or something like that i mean the the one thing that stands out to me so you
know twitter sure right people get i mean one of the things that i have found striking
right like often you have people on twitter and i think in the crypto space is very common
who just seem like horrible people on twitter right they're like so aggressive and like
totally and then i met some of these people in real life and they're like this huge difference
like oh this is actually like nice reasonable person uh or seemingly like that so i like
i i think that scenario personally it doesn't seem i mean i could see it happen but i don't
find it so concerning but then the scenario and i think you've talked about that too right
of basically people saying okay let's target crypto users and go in and try to extort them
or steal uh their funds uh and and i remember reading a while ago there was some guy in
norway who was i think doing some bitcoin trading and you know somebody went in to his
house and tried to steal the bitcoins and then he killed the guy so i think that kind
of thing yeah dozens dozens of those incidents and in fact we just saw a guy tweeting earlier
today about his friend in oman i believe was physically robbed and assaulted and then i
saw another piece of news pop up about someone actually being murdered in japan after meeting
someone at a bitcoin meetup trying to find like more source material on that but um you
know that's a part of the the problem i guess with being an early adopter in this space
is that it's it's a it's kind of a paradox where it's it's not a good idea to talk about
like money and wealth and assets but we also have a incentive to talk about these networks
because we want them to grow we want to get more people to come into the networks and
expend their own resources to build the networks and evolve them and so as soon as you start
talking about being interested in these things then you've created a point in time where
an attacker might go back and look at your history and say oh they've been talking about
you know bitcoin since 2010 or ethereum since 2015 or whatever and and then you know the
attacker starts extrapolating well you know they could have you know this many millions
of dollars and they probably don't have bank level security so you know if i'm weighing
my options of where i get some easy money you know do i rob a bank or do i go find this
crypto person who probably has a bunch of money you know under their mattress in a hardware
wallet and i just need the five dollar wrench attack and so that is one thing specific to
i guess people who are in the crypto space is that you know we're we're talking about
these highly liquid bearer assets and if if you are going to go down the path of being
your own bank you have to actually understand everything that is involved in being your
own bank so i guess just before we're about maybe we can briefly talk about something
that ties in very nicely here so the company that you're cto of kasa is that you know you
you're building basically this sort of custody self-custody solution for bitcoin is that's
also presumably one of the you know scenarios that you try to protect against like this
five dollar wrench attack or can you talk a little bit about like what this product looks like
yeah so that the first service that that we started offering at kasa is the key master
service which is basically a vault product it's a three out of five multi-sig bitcoin wallet
and what's different about this wallet there's a few things one is that it is mostly backed by
hardware devices and we support off-the-shelf hardware devices like trezor and ledger and
the the premise is that it's not only multi-sig it's multi-device and multi-location so we're
building in a level of redundancy and robustness and minimizing any single points of failure
to every aspect of the system that we can in order to protect not only against theft but also
against loss and and when i say loss i generally mean you know something happening where the user
screws up and they can no longer access their keys and and basically poof all the money is gone but
nobody has stolen it in my experience and in from some of the analysis that has been done
like by chain analysis we estimate that twice as many bitcoins have actually been lost than have
been stolen so it's the fact that users are generally not it experts or even if they are
technical like myself it's just annoying like nobody wants to go through really boring data
backup and like backup integrity testing checks and all of this other stuff like nobody wants to
spend even you know an hour a year doing that and i was spending one to two days every year refreshing
my own cold storage setup which was this custom thing that used like shamir secret sharing and
and you know sharded out these encrypted file containers across various people that i semi-trusted
and you know just thinking through all of the different attack and failure scenarios is exhausting
so we've basically created a very user-friendly app on ios and android where if you can read the
screen and you know follow the the workflows on the screen then it's really as simple as you know
plugging in your hardware devices that you buy and and following our our guidelines for you know how
to initialize them and test them and do you know health checks every now and then the one thing
that we did that had not been done before is that we actually got rid of the need for storing
recovery seed phrases so with our solution when you actually set up your your wallet
we tell you not to write down the seed phrases and that is by design because you know users are
terrible at security and if if the user has to keep a seed phrase secure then that's this whole
other basically iceberg of security knowledge that needs to be ingested by them so by getting
rid of that they can instead just think of their security in physical terms you know where are my
physical hardware devices you know distribute them in different access controlled locations
and that's a lot easier to reason about and so this is generally what we're trying to do at casa
we also have other products one of which is the node plug and play node product and we've got a
few other things that are coming out pretty soon but we're from a very high level trying to
bring usability to the masses when it comes to securities we want to decrease the level of

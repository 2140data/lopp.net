Hi, everyone. We're back with the Bitcoin security and privacy panel moderated by Michael
Perklin, featuring Jameson Lopp, Jimmy Song, and Michael Flaxman. I'll introduce Michael
Perklin very briefly. He's a cryptocurrency security expert, having provided over a decade
of contributions to the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry. He currently serves as CISO, Chief
Information Security Officer of ShapeShift, and president of C4. He's also the co-author
of the Cryptocurrency Security Standard. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be moderating
this panel. I have the pleasure of serving this panel with a few of my colleagues in
this space. We have Jameson Lopp, we have Jimmy Song, and we have Michael Flaxman. Jameson,
why don't you go introduce yourself to the audience?
Sure. I'm CTO of CASA. We are a provider of multisig self-custody services. Prior to that,
I was also doing multisig self-custody at the enterprise level with BitGo and just been
a general Bitcoin enthusiast for a number of years.
Thank you. Michael Flaxman, why don't you introduce yourself to the audience?
Yeah. I guess I can say long time Bitcoiner now. I had my first commit to PiCoin in 2013.
I write the 10x Bitcoin security guide on how to use multisig to secure your Bitcoin.
I'm a co-maintainer of the Biddle Python Bitcoin Library with Jimmy Song also on this panel.
Thank you, Michael. And Jimmy.
I am a Bitcoin author, educator, and entrepreneur. I've written three books, Programming Bitcoin
from O'Reilly, The Little Bitcoin Book, and Thank God for Bitcoin, all of which talk about
Bitcoin from various aspects. I'm a long time open source contributor to various Bitcoin
projects, including Bitcoin Core.
Thank you, Jimmy. For everyone in the audience, the panel met earlier this week to discuss
some topics that we would be chatting about on stage here with you. We've got some great
topics that are going to come up. The first one that I think is one of the most important
when you're dealing with security is that there is always going to be trade-offs between
every decision that you make. And depending on what your threat model is and what your
goals are, different trade-offs make more sense.
Jameson, you brought this topic up when we were planning. I'd like to go to you first.
What types of trade-offs do you recommend people take or consider when planning their
security model with Bitcoin?
This is one of the things where there's no one-size-fits-all solution. When I was working
in the enterprise setting, there tended to be a more common set of threat models and
issues that enterprises who are dealing with having to transact constantly, they are worried
about that from having basically a target painted on their back. But I think what more
people here are going to be interested in is the individual perspective of, I'm trying
to be my own bank and what am I trying to protect myself against? And I think that a
lot of people, especially if they're spending time researching this space, you're going
to run into the crazy hardcore edge cases. People are worried about 6102 style confiscation,
nation state level attacks or whatever. But really what I think people need to be most
worried about is shooting yourself in the foot. And I think a lot of people don't put
themselves into their own threat model. So that's the first thing that I try to get across
to people is that it's not all about creating the most insane level of security because
if you manage to achieve perfect security, then you've actually locked yourself out of
being able to access your own assets. So rather what I try to get across to a lot of people
is that you want resilience and redundancy in addition to just going to the extreme of
security at the expense of convenience. And that's where it's hard to talk about all of
the details that go into that. But this is why we're having these discussions is so that
we understand that we need to have multiple outs. We need to be able to recover for various
failure scenarios.
Yeah. And Jameson brings up a really good point. Security and convenience tend to be
sort of contrasted against one another. And if you have very strict security, what you're
going to get is not a lot of convenience. Because if you have like multi-sig spread
over multiple jurisdictions and so on, it's not going to be very convenient for you to
go access that Bitcoin. So it really depends on who you are. If you are somebody that's
using Bitcoin as a store of value for the long term and you don't need to access it
for the next five years, yeah, by all means go and put keys in different jurisdictions
and have all sorts of multi-sig setups and make it very difficult for yourself to access
that Bitcoin so that others have a very difficult time also accessing that Bitcoin should they
try to attack it. But if you're a trader, if you're somebody that needs to access your
Bitcoin quite frequently, or if you're a business that needs to access cold storage on a fairly
regular basis, that level of convenience needs to be higher than having it in multiple jurisdictions
in a giant multi-sig setup or something like that. So that is the particular trade off
that you generally have to think about with security is that it does tend to come at the
price of convenience. And it's for that reason that you need to think about who you are as
a Bitcoin holder, like what you're planning to do with it and how you plan to use it.
I think one of the big things that's often that I often harp on in Bitcoin is the value
of multi-sig because it allows you to make mistakes. And we think of Bitcoin as the scary
thing where you're going to make one mistake and you're going to lose all your Bitcoin.
There's been stories since forever about somebody throwing out a hard drive or forgetting a
password and being locked out of a massive fortune. The reality of where multi-sig is
and in theory, what it offers are still a little bit of a gap. It's still not as easy
to use as I would like it to be for everyone. But in theory, multi-sig is this amazing win
because you're allowed to make horrible mistakes. And depending on your threshold, like in a
three of five example, you could make two horrific mistakes. And as long as you have
access to three hardware wallets, you'd still be able to spend your funds. So having that
no single point of failure in multi-sig is a really, really good thing.
I think the biggest vulnerability is just in practice, there's a lot of difficult details,
getting the hardware wallets to play nicely with one another, having to run your own node.
Even the way you verify like are my other hardware wallets part of this multi-sig quorum
is all kind of complicated now and it is getting easier all the time. So I think the biggest
vulnerabilities are these detail things that are there still room to get wrong. But the
thing that's important to remember is that Bitcoin is actually the most secureable asset
in human history and that that's a new thing. You cannot two of three or three or five year
gold. Only Bitcoin can offer this. And I would argue that no altcoin can either. I mean,
we've seen Ethereum have a massive loss in the parity multi-sig contract and that's sort
of something to be expected when you have a complex smart contracting language and not
a simple statically analyzable smart contracting language like Bitcoin has. So multi-sig provides
this unbelievable level of security that's never existed in the world, but it's just
a little bit complicated right now.
And these types of trade off. So go ahead, James. I was just going to say this can also
be really overwhelming. You know, the three of us are probably going to be talking about
some crazy low level details that we understand because we live and breathe this stuff. But
I can imagine that most people who are in the audience, people who are just dipping
their toes into this, they start hearing security experts talk about how to do like the extreme
perfect security setup and they're just going to feel totally overwhelmed. And I think one
of my biggest fears is that that will turn people off from even trying to move into self
custody. I don't want people to feel like, well, this is so complicated that I might
as well just leave all my money on the exchange.
Yeah, there's always going to be a trade off when dealing with these things. And while
we're talking to some of the specific technical aspects of it, generally speaking, when you
look at the information theory of security, Jimmy mentioned there was that trade off.
It's a three point trade off between confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If you maximize
confidentiality, the secretness of your key, you're going to minimize either the availability
of that key or the integrity of it or both. Similarly, if you make it incredibly available
because now you've copied it into five or 10 places across multiple places, sure, it's
more available, but now you're compromising the confidentiality of your key. It's these
trade offs that you have to make in general. And once you've decided on that model, then
you go into the specifics of multi SIG or something else. I'm a firm believer that just
like today, people have better password hygiene today in 2021 compared to the 1980s and 1990s
when computing first started taking the world by storm. It took 20 years for us to become
comfortable with passwords and know the pitfalls of reusing passwords and not using proper
character sets in your passwords and things like that. It's my belief that 20 years from
now, everyone will be so comfortable with private key security just as they are today
with password security. Sure, there will still be some people who are doing it wrong, maybe
reusing a key in multiple places, but the children that are growing up today will grow
up in a private key controlled world. And I think that's really exciting.
Next I'd like to talk a little bit about something that's being built on Bitcoin that is giving
a lot of benefits to Bitcoin users, and that is lightning. With lightning, there are a
lot of great benefits to the Bitcoiners with also its own trade offs. Again, you have that
tug of war between the different aspects that you optimize for. We were talking before this
panel about some of the trade offs between lightning security and usability. Jimmy, why
don't you start us off with lightning security and usability?
Lightning is extremely convenient in the sense that you don't need any confirmations on the
on chain or whatever. You can send extremely small amounts for very low fees and so on.
If you've tried something like Sphinx Chat or the Breeze podcasting app or whatever,
you know exactly how quickly you can do that stuff. The only problem with lightning is
sort of that security model. You have to have your node online as you're spending, and if
you're a routing node, you need your private keys online the entire duration that you're
routing because you can't route anything without your private key. The security model is significantly
different than one of Bitcoin where you could keep your private key offline and so on. There's
not really much choice but to keep it online at least some time. That of course does expose
it to the internet and so on. I think there are ways to maybe once in a while, if you
have a fat channel open with an exchange or something like that, you could keep the key
offline and sign just the funding transactions or something to that effect. That said, it
generally tends to be harder to secure but it is extremely convenient. For small amounts
of money and for micro transactions, I think lightning makes all the sense in the world.
From a security perspective, I would say that it enables something like a decentralized
web that we've all been wanting. Instead of keeping your passwords on a centralized website
like Facebook or Twitter or whatever, you can have things like SphinxChat which are
completely peer-to-peer and you don't store any of your credentials anywhere and so on.
From that perspective, I think lightning is an order of magnitude improvement over the
current web as it is structured. It's going in the right direction but that said, it's
from a monetary perspective versus Bitcoin on-chain. It really is more vulnerable though.
We haven't yet seen too many people get hacked on that necessarily but it is more risk.
Jameson, do you have anything to add?
This is I would say at a point where I'm actually kind of pleasantly surprised that there haven't
been more disasters with lightning. I think I wrote a fairly lengthy post six or seven
years ago where I outlined a few different potential disaster scenarios of essentially
like network collapse or economic issues that could happen. While lightning does have its
share of issues around potential economic attacks or privacy attacks that have been
sort of spoken about academically, I don't think that we've seen too much that has actually
been carried out. This whole thing of course is an interesting ongoing experiment because
there has never really been a financial network constructed in this way before. To me, it's
still something fascinating to continue to watch and evolve and I'm hopeful that someday
I will feel confident enough to participate from a large economic standpoint. Basically
doing my own type of yield farming as it were, liquidity providing on the lightning network.
I have seen up hand just for running a routing node, if you're going to do it with large
amounts of money, you really need to be almost like at the enterprise level of IT infrastructure
provider simply because there are a number of different single points of failure, things
that can cause you to have funds loss that are all a direct result of what Jimmy said
of the fact that you have to have these keys online, you have to have these other databases
that are constantly being written to and if you lose that data you may or may not be able
to go into certain manual recovery scenarios and it can get pretty gnarly as I actually
wrote a blog post about a couple months ago of a number of different nasty data and funds
recovery scenarios that I've run into over the years.
That's right, with traditional Bitcoin the only thing that you really need to worry about
backing up is your key and whether you choose to keep that key offline or online you can
receive coins and you can participate in the Bitcoin network. With lightning with the extra
convenience of micro payments and nothing being written to chain, while you have those
benefits what you bring up Jameson is absolutely true, there's more than just the key that
you need to back up with the constant state that is ever changing and while it may be
accessible to people who have significant amounts of money to open up a variety of channels
with other participants, not everybody is able to open up a lightning channel. One other
difference between lightning and Bitcoin is the requirement to put up your own capital
into a channel. For example, opening a channel worth $100 between myself and Jameson allowing
me to participate in the lightning network and all the other connections that Jameson
may have beyond his note, if I don't have that $100 to open up a channel I can't participate
in the network to receive my 0.05 micro payment. Now of course you don't have to put up 100
Bitcoin in a channel, you can put up less but there is still a higher barrier of entry
than what traditional Bitcoin offers where as long as you have a key, you don't need
any capital to receive your funds and keep it secure offline.
Is that true because I don't think you need any funds in order to have a channel open
to you so you can have a one-way channel where somebody opens $100 worth of Bitcoin into
you and then you can receive as much as that channel capacity allows, if I'm not mistaken.
It doesn't have to be bidirectional.
I think there's the theory and then there's the reality and that I think that one of the
more interesting challenges going forward here is going to be less on the technical
side and more on the economic side of how do we push a lot of the complexities of figuring
out liquidity under the hood. My personal belief is that I don't think that Lightning
Network is going to be a mainstream thing until we can abstract away a lot of the fact
that there are channels even happening under the hood. Channel management is not something
that we would want the average person to have to even think about.
One of the main things that I think is important there is to get more and more liquidity providers
onto the Lightning Network and then figure out ways to make these integrations more seamless.
You should be able to basically have an exchange provide liquidity since they already have
a lot of funds. This is where also I think the lightning pool technology that they're
working on is going to come into play. I know that there's active outreach happening from
lightning labs to figure out how do we bring together the people who have the liquidity
with the people who want the liquidity and figure out the best way to build the technology
to make that happen.
Awesome. You're absolutely right, Jameson, that today programs are still working on the
plumbing that everyone will be using tomorrow. I compare it in my mind to the engineers who
worked on TCP IP and then HTTP that was built on top of it. Today we are able to grab our
tablet and have a video call with grandma on the other side of the planet so easily
that you're not even thinking about HTTP connections and TCP channels. I look forward to the user
interfaces that will be built on top of these technical primitives to make Bitcoin super
easy to use in the future for everyone who comes after us.
Let's put this technical stuff aside. I know that in our audience, while we do have some
very technical people, we also have some fairly un-technical people. Bitcoin can be used by
anybody. I'd like to ask the panelists, if you had to share just one or maybe two maximum
suggestions for improving people's Bitcoin security or privacy, what would your suggestions
be? I'll get us started. I think one of the easiest things that somebody can do to improve
their security is actually a unicorn in the security world. Usually, whenever you add
security to something, you're going to be making it a little bit more complicated. For
example, we all have seen 2FA. In addition to entering your username and your password,
now you have to enter in a six-digit code that you get from somewhere. That does make
your account more secure, but it also makes it a little bit more annoying for you because
now there's that third thing that you have to be typing in. One unicorn in the security
industry is password managers. A password manager can improve your security hygiene
by making it very easy to create long, unique passwords for every individual site that are
never reused and also make it easier for you to log in because now, instead of typing a
very long password that you have memorized, which you could forget or could make a typo,
with a single click, your password manager will copy and paste the password into the
login box, regardless of whether your password is 5 characters long or 128 characters long.
Simply adopting the use of a password manager in your personal life will dramatically improve
the security that you have on all the sites that you connect. That's my number one security
tip for anyone looking to improve their operational security. Michael Flaxman, do you have any
tips that you would recommend to any new people in the space?
Yeah, a similar one to password manager is U2F keys. This is a little physical piece
of hardware. It looks like a Bitcoin hardware wallet, but it's not for storing Bitcoin.
It's just for authenticating you when you log into trusted services, which could be
an exchange where you're buying Bitcoin. That's a great example of one you're holding
up right now. It could be a hosted service like Google or Dropbox or Twitter or Facebook.
It's a really easy to use thing. When you go to log in, it asks you this extra challenge.
It says, put in your U2F key and hit the button on there. Most of them don't even have screens
or anything. It's like literally just hit the button, but it means that for somebody
to steal your U2F key for access to your site, they would have to physically come into your
home and take it, which is enormously more tricky than, say, guessing your weak password,
for example. U2F keys are great. Once you have them, you just add them to every service
you use. It's amazing. Even login.gov for if you use any services there takes a U2F key,
and once you have them, you may even want to get multiple, but you don't have to start
that way. I keep one in a safe deposit box, and I keep one at home, and I keep one in
my travel bag. I can always just have that access should everything else melt down. U2F
keys are great. You can get them. Google sells one Titan key that's highly reputable for
$25. You can buy different ones on Amazon for $20. That's a great way to help you with
authentication, which is a different problem than storing Bitcoin, but you're probably
going to buy Bitcoin somewhere, and they should support U2F keys. You should secure your account
that way, and it just requires no tech know-how. You'll just figure it out. It's really easy
to use.
That's right. As much as attackers can remotely connect to your computer, they cannot do touch
over IP, at least not yet. Jimmy, do you have anything to add? What would you recommend
to people looking to secure their account?
Well, the first thing, and I've run Twitter polls on my Twitter account, and the thing
that still shocks me is that a vast majority of people just still keep their Bitcoins on
an exchange. This has traditionally been the biggest security hole for most Bitcoin holders.
The biggest fail in Bitcoin history was Mt. Gox when they went bankrupt. There's a lot
of people that would have a lot more money if they simply kept their own Bitcoins instead
of leaving it on Mt. Gox, for example. Getting it off the exchange and getting into hardware
wallets or self-custody of some way, shape, or form, that I think is the first step. Now,
that tends to be very scary for a lot of people because we're not used to bear instruments
or things that we have to secure on our own. It does require some level of technical understanding,
but I think that's the main step that most people can take. We haven't had a major exchange
go down as a result of a hack in a while, but I think it's inevitable, whether through
internal hacking, external hacking, rehypothecation, or just bad loans or something like that.
It's inevitable, and it will happen. I think a lot of people have been conditioned over
the last three or four years to think that nothing bad is going to happen and I could
keep it on this thing for five years or something like that. I generally don't think that's
a very good bet, and it's a very big risk to your Bitcoin if you're keeping all your
coins on an exchange.
We've actually seen a number of exchanges still getting hacked. The total number of
exchanges getting hacked is going up, but I think that they are newer and smaller exchanges.
If I recall correctly from the stats that I ran at the end of the year, it's like fewer
Bitcoin are being stolen and it's more altcoins that are being stolen in large quantities.
It's probably just because new people, new companies coming into these spaces not knowing
any of the best practices and basically repeating the mistakes of the past. In terms of general
security, if I was going to talk just to a regular person, I would actually advocate
minimalism and by minimalism, what I mean is stop installing every little piece of software
you come across, stop adding a million different browser extensions to your browser for convenience,
especially stop downloading and installing every little crypto price ticker or crypto
whatever thing because you're exposing yourself to a higher likelihood of malware.
The real world reason that I say this is that we've had a number of clients come to us at
Casa and we've been walking them through setting up a multi-sig wallet and they'll have never
had a Trezor before. This has happened multiple times. I've seen it. They go to plug in their
Trezor for the first time and it automatically pops up a webpage that is actually a fake
Trezor malware page and is asking them to put their seed phrase into it. They're like,
is this normal? Should I be doing this? We really have no stop everything, burn your
computer, go buy a new computer. I think there's a lot of people out there who probably have
those specific malware that's already on your computer just laying in wait for you to try
to do something so that they can try to trick you into getting your private keys.
That's a great point. There are so many copycat apps out there that impersonate the Trezor
app or impersonate the KeepKey app or whatever crypto app that people use. Usually the dead
giveaway is it's asking for your seed phrase. For those in the audience who aren't aware,
most Bitcoin clients, the other generator asks you to enter a mnemonic sentence. This
is 12 or 24 words that create all of your private keys. It's only ever needed the first
time you set up that Bitcoin client and it's never needed again. One telltale sign that
you've got malware is whenever you're opening up your Bitcoin program, it's asking you
for that seed phrase when you've already set up that Trezor or you've already set up that
Ledger wallet. Making sure that you're using the real apps from the real publishers is
absolutely important. Once you have those apps, you're able to send and receive Bitcoin
on chain. There's another aspect of security that we haven't touched on yet on the panel
and that is privacy. With a public Ledger for everyone in the world to write to and
to read from, anybody can see where any amount of Bitcoins are transferring. Sure, at first
you see one Bitcoin address to another Bitcoin address and you may not be able to immediately
tell who is controlling address one or address two. Once you know that you've received some
funds from Michael Perklin, you can ask him, well, where did you get those funds from?
You can start to peel apart the history of all these transactions and get a real world
picture of how much wealth people may have online. What strategies are there to minimize
your data footprint or to maximize your privacy when using public blockchains like Bitcoins?
Do any of you have suggestions? I'll jump in. What I like to say about Bitcoin is that
it's as private as you want it to be and the default setting is not very private. By default,
it is hard to get privacy right in Bitcoin. You're probably buying your coins on an exchange.
That exchange is asking you for KYC information like your driver's license and social security
or utility bills so they know who you are. They're probably record sharing with blockchain
analysis companies like Chainalysis that are basically spying on behalf of the government
and doing that with all the other exchanges. If you send Bitcoins to somebody and they
withdraw them in an exchange, then they'll probably be able to figure that out too. Then
of course, how you're storing those coins. If you're using a hardware wallet that shares
the Xpubs with a server somewhere, it's sharing, here's my collection of addresses, then you've
also doxed yourself there. Privacy is hard. You need to buy your coins anonymously. You
need to run your own node so that you're not querying third-party services. Now, maybe
you could argue like Electrum behind Tor would be sufficient, but there are trade-offs there
and that's non-trivial as well. Unfortunately, the privacy story in Bitcoin is hard, but
it's actually not nearly as bad as it sounds because number one, the fact that Bitcoin
doesn't rely on any zero-knowledge proofs or anything like that means that it's very
easy to audit the supply, which is what I think and what many Bitcoiners think is by
far the most important thing in Bitcoin. We can all trivially verify the 21 million Bitcoin
supply cap on the most basic of hardware. That guarantee is always true and that's what gives
us the confidence in the monetary policy. I actually think that that's a feature, not
a bug. The second part of it is that as much as it might be uncomfortable for people to
know how much Bitcoin you have or to see your Bitcoin transactions, fundamentally, privacy
and security are different things. Now, if it's known that you have a lot of Bitcoin,
you've just painted a target on your back. That's not ideal. That said, the richest people
in the world, at least we don't hear about it, don't tend to be getting robbed. The real
reality of it is that all assets are liquid on a long enough time horizon. You won't see
a Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk vacationing in Venezuela because that would be very dangerous,
but there are not like kidnap and ransom operations in the US because it would be so hard to rob
somebody in this way. You would need so much support. You would literally need to hold
somebody hostage for days, potentially weeks. Any person who is involved in that in any
way would go to jail for a very long time if they were caught.
In practice, it's an uncomfortable topic, but it's not that different from a rich person
who's CEO of a company or who's known to own a lot of property. All assets are liquid on
a long enough time horizon. Bitcoin is just unique in that with a gun held to your head
in a single key setup where you have the hardware wall in front of you, you can just hit send
and move it. In practice, most people keep their coins in a more secure setup anyway
where you'd have to go into a safe deposit box at a bank to get them out and they're
only open Monday to Friday during bank hours and they have silent alarms and you have to
show ID and sign and all that. It's a scary, uncomfortable thing, but I don't think wealth
is a new topic and I don't think Bitcoin fundamentally changes that.
It is a threat model issue. This is also one of my side projects is whenever I hear about
a physical attack that is against someone who is being targeted because they have Bitcoin,
I put that on my GitHub project for it and I think there have only been 60 something
in the decade plus of history that we're aware of and close to the majority of them I think
are people who are engaging in high-risk behavior, aka doing face-to-face high-value Bitcoin
trades with people that they don't know. There was actually one just a few weeks ago. Some
guy in Germany met some other random guy in a parking lot and ended up getting his wallet
physically snatched out of his hand when he unlocked it.
Policy like security is a very complicated topic and it's really a question of what are
you trying to be private from? Usually, once again, when experts come together to talk
about this type of stuff, it's usually the crazy, insane edge case of how do we remain
100% private from nation-state level surveillance? What are all of the tools at our disposal
for that? While that is certainly theoretically possible, I think it's out of reach for most
of the non-technical people who aren't immersed in this stuff around the clock because it
is a very brittle type of environment to be living in. You make one single mistake and
that can haunt you for the rest of your life. We've seen this time and time again when you
look at usually a court case related things, how did the investigators end up tracking
down this person? It was usually because of one stupid thing they did years ago that unfortunately,
because the internet does not forget, they were never able to get away from.
I would say that with respect to privacy, despite an unpopular opinion, but I think
the risks of privacy loss are a little bit overrated. A lot of people tend to overestimate
how much privacy loss can be used against you and not enough on just general common
sense security like securing your own keys and not keeping it in an exchange and so on.
A privacy hole is a security hole and I agree with that, but it's not as big of a security
hole as you might think. That said, if you can get privacy, all the much better, but
to some degree, it's overstated the amount of data that you need to gather in order to
really dox people and the scale at which you need to do it, it usually doesn't come out
to be economically viable for your attacker. That's just my personal opinion.
The one thing that I'll say about, I think one of the most popular privacy preserving
technologies, CoinJoin and Bitcoin, there are certainly some people who love CoinJoin.
They talk about it all the time. I've experimented with the various CoinJoin providers. I tried
being a market maker on join market for a while to see what the liquidity provider yield
was that I could get for that. Really ended up barely breaking even on there and ended
up not doing it for the long term because I was making another trade off where I was
having to keep those private keys online in order to provide that liquidity for join market.
I think a lot of people gloss over that security versus privacy trade off with CoinJoin.
In general, I don't think it makes a ton of sense to be constantly CoinJoin from a real
world usability standpoint. If I want to make a private transaction, then I'll send the
money through a mixer and then make the payment directly after that rather than trying to
keep some pool of constantly mixed funds going on because you run into all of these other
UTXO management issues if you're constantly trying to deal with your privacy UTXOs.
Great points to add, Jameson. Thank you. At this point, with only 10 and a half minutes
left until the top of the hour, I'd like to turn to audience questions. We've got one
question from an audience member. What happens with Bitcoin network security when the hash
rate drops abruptly? Does the network become more suitable to a 51% attack? I think this
is a great question. I'll start us off by mentioning that Bitcoin adjusts its difficulty
level every 2016 blocks. Now, normally, with an average of 10 minutes between blocks, 2016
blocks should take about two weeks. However, if the hash rate drops abruptly, it may take
a long time until the last of those 2016 blocks are mined, allowing the network to adjust
the difficulty downward. Until that happens, there's no increased risk of a 51% attack,
but after that happens, the lower the global hash rate is, the easier it is for a motivated
attacker to get 51% of it by running their own miners in a data center or worse, by infecting
enough malware in enough machines around the world that they can control that hash rate.
At first, no, there's no increase, but eventually, there may be. Do any other panelists want
to add to this answer about the hash rate? We haven't really seen any huge abrupt hash
rate fluctuations that I can think of. I think difficulty adjustments tend to be less than
10%, at least in the past few years. The one scenario that might cause this, it would once
again be a sort of nation state issue is if, for example, like China tried to somehow ratchet
down their great firewall and cut all of the miners in China off, that could be an interesting
split scenario, but it's unlikely that something like that would be able to persist because
you only have to punch one hole through and the data required for Bitcoin is so minimal.
You can balance it off the ionosphere. It's really hard for even a first world nation
to be able to prevent the flow of information like that. I think it would require something
even more resource intensive and onerous. Some of these edge cases that people talk
about of what if China sent in their army to all of the mining farms and tried to nationalize
them all, et cetera, et cetera. It gets into some interesting game theory scenarios, but
I think the fact that we haven't seen anything like that happen makes it seem less and less
likely that it's going to, but you never know. These things are interesting to talk about.
They're hard to put or quantify an actual risk percentage on.
It's important to keep in mind when we think about the threat of a 51% attack that there's
two models you can think about it. One is like a nation state trying to cripple Bitcoin
and there's been tons of talk about this and it would be very expensive and difficult to
pull off stealthily. In some ways, it could drive prices up for Bitcoin while they're
trying to secure mining equipment. That's one topic that's been very well covered.
The other one is, is it a 51% attack against you? Is an exchange trying to trick you into
depositing your Bitcoin or sending you Bitcoin in exchange for something else and then double
spending you? This is just not a credible threat. No one is going to show up and buy
your car and send you Bitcoin and double spend you. Obviously, you want to wait the number
of confirmations that would make that transaction considered safe enough, but there is nobody
amassing giant hash power to steal a Honda Civic in a Bitcoin transaction. I think a
lot of times that we know of. It would be just wildly out of line with the cost benefit
of that attack. It's a thing that we need to be mindful of, but it's basically the nation
state version and it's very expensive to pull off and you have to sustain it for a very
long time. I think the biggest issue of a hash power drop is that that two-week recalculation
is every 2016 blocks, which should be two weeks on average. The problem is, is if hash
power fell off a cliff for some reason, maybe I'm trying to think of what that scenario
would be like blackouts in all of China for a week or something and they just couldn't
run anything, including mining equipment. It'd have to be something crazy. If that happened,
that two-week adjustment would actually take much longer because it's 2016 blocks and it
could take a long time to find them. Then you could get a ton of fee pressure in that
short period of time. Fees might shoot through the roof and it would be total chaos as people
scrambled to get their transactions confirmed until that difficulty adjustment in the case
of say losing half the hash power, it might take four weeks instead of two weeks. It would
be unpleasant, but it wouldn't really do anything.
Great. I have to interject in the interest of time. I appreciate everybody's thoughts
and inputs on our audience's questions. Thank you, Michael, Jameson and Jimmy for the engaging
debate this morning. We are now entering our first break of the day for 15 minutes before
everybody gets up for a cup of coffee or to stretch their legs. I just wanted to remind
everybody that we do have online networking in the GatherTown Multiverse. We fixed the
link below the stream in case anybody wants to join. They can find Expo committee members,
speakers, sponsors to come and watch it. You can see here I'm actually in a watch party
of the Expo. Also, we have our Discord, which is also linked below where you can just find
help about the hackathon, find help from Expo committee members. Finally, we also are running
a merch store this year, also linked below. I hope you guys enjoy it.
Thank you so much.

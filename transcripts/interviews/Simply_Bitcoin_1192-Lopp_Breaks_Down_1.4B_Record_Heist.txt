yo bitcoin has seen one of its most volatile weeks in history after we saw a record-breaking
1.4 billion dollar heist that occurred last week this massive bybit hack from an infamous nation
nation state hacker group has forced many people to reconsider how they hold their bitcoin today
we reached out to a bitcoin og with a over a what is happening
there we go sorry about that guys i have i have my echo in the background today we reached out to
a bitcoin og with a decade decade of experience in cyber security to break down everything that
happened with this hack and also this morning it was uh opti and i had to put a fire out which was
absolutely crazy uh we had some trouble getting the live stream up and going which we managed to fix
10 minutes before the show went live and of course what bitcoin og am i talking about we have the one
the only legendary jameson lop in the house thank you so much for joining us lop i know we've had you
on simply bitcoin irl but we've never had you on simply bitcoin live so welcome to the show
always glad to talk about bitcoin it's so crazy because every time we have a big guest coming and
joining us uh those are the days that something goes wrong so we're rolling with the punches anyways
let's jump straight into today's article let me pull it up fbi accuses north korean backed hackers
of stealing 1.5 billion dollars in crypto from dubai based firm it goes on to say the fbi has accused
north korean linked hackers of conducting one of the largest thefts of cryptocurrency publicly known
seizing some 1.5 billion dollars worth of ethereum from a dubai based firm the theft earlier this month
targeting by bit one of the world's largest crypto exchanges represents yet another uh another involving
a team of hackers identified by the u.s government by the names of trader trader and the lazarus group
the hackers steal cryptocurrency through the disseminate the dissemination of cryptocurrency
trading applications that were modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency
it goes on to say in an online public service announcement late wednesday the fbi said it
believed the north korean backed hackers were quote responsible for the theft quote trader trader
actors are proceeding rapidly and have converted some of that stolen assets to bitcoin i think that's
the signal there right they're getting rid you know of of whatever and they're they're buying bitcoin
other virtual asset uh uh dispersed across thousands of addresses on multiple black uh blockchains the fbi
said in this announcement quote it is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually
converted to fiat currency it goes on to say north korean state media has not acknowledged either the
theft or the fbi accusation pyongyang's mission to the united nations in geneva did not respond to a request for
comment from the associated press now here is a post from i believe the bybit ceo uh ben zoo and he said
bybic hack uh forensic reports as promised here are the preliminary reports of the hack conducted by uh
singa labs and vera chains screenshotted the conclusion here is the link to the full report
and lop we were talking about it earlier before we went on air about uh this uh report that came
out so uh lop what happened how did this happen how can an exchange of this size with this many
customers uh how our exchange happen how are exchange hacks still happening in 2025 you know after the
industry has been around for you know almost 16 years now we all remember mount gox you know i think
bitfinex got hacked a couple times binance got hacked how is this stuff still happening
well these are complex systems and you know complexity can be the enemy of security i think
that's the short version of how this happened there's complexity of many different layers
and it really starts at the very lowest layer there's a lot of complexity on these evm turing complete
uh protocols and that level of complexity means that you can't have the same trustless verification that
we do on bitcoin if you're using one of these tiny uh low powered hardware key management devices
so you know if you've ever used trezor ledger cold card really any of those hardware devices then you know
that when you're making a bitcoin transaction it explicitly tells you on the screen hey you're
ascending this many sats and you're sending it to this address and you can confirm it all on what is
essentially a totally self-contained computer and that's possible to do because bitcoin is simple
and you the partially or fully signed transaction that you are sending to that device is usually only
a few hundred bytes maybe a few kilobytes and it's capable of parsing it and telling you exactly what
the resulting change into the blockchain is going to be but with these more complex evm type of protocols
you're not signing a transaction that has all of that context inside of it uh you may be signing a
more complex transaction that's basically sending a command you know to the evm and the only way to know
what the result of executing that command is is to actually execute the command so you have to have
your own full node basically where you do a test and you then check the state's change of what actually
happened from executing the transaction so in the short version is that you can't sign these complex
transactions on secure air-gapped hardware because the hardware itself simply does not have all of the
the contextual information necessary to know what the final outcome is of that transaction and then beyond
that there's just multiple other layers of of problems that happened in this one particular case
particularly that they were using a web app you know a javascript front end to actually drive the creation
and the coordination of this multi-sig setup and anyone who is familiar with javascript and web apps know
that they are just incredibly difficult to secure because you can't have integrity checks for the code
itself uh you know if you're running a mobile app or in in many cases a desktop app those applications
can be cryptographically signed like the final build of the app can be cryptographically signed
by the developers of that app and that provides a strong uh attestation and integrity check that
the code that you're running is the code that was actually written by those developers but with javascript
that's just not a thing and so what happened in this case is it appears that lazarus group which is
these you know north korean uh state-backed actors somehow compromised the aws like s3 bucket or cloud flare
bucket like wherever this javascript was actually hosted they managed to insert a few lines of
malicious code that basically said hey if this is the bybit wallet that is being used to construct and
sign this transaction then do this malicious contract call that completely changes the ownership of the
contract and they were able to do that because you know whatever code they put up there just immediately
actually gets uh sucked down into the browser and run and there's no integrity checks to make sure that
the code was actually written by the gnosis safe developers so they basically they were able to
completely bypass any of the security mechanisms that's the safe team may have had around you know code
review peer review the build and deploy process and it appears that this happened because a developer had some sort of production access api key on their machine and that machine
got compromised that we don't know all of the details at this time so and and it's it's a couple things
so many things to unpack there right so the first the first question that i have for you lop and you know of
course we recommend you know bitcoin only hardware wallets but i'm sure that a lot of our listeners still use ledger
it was the ledger device itself it's not compromise it's the fact that it can't lay out all the data
effectively on on the constraints of the hardware itself and on the screen size so you can't really
actually confirm what it is you're signing and if you compare and contrast that with bitcoin it's pretty
straightforward it's like look here's your bitcoin address here's the change address a lot of good
hardware wallets actually lay that out for you bitcoin only hardware wallets so it's not the
actual ledger device itself that was compromised it was something that was compromised on the software
level how how were they able to do that was is it so essentially did did a developer download like
a malicious software is that what happened probably uh it's too early to say because i think the only
forensic report that has been released was performed by bybit or at bybit's request i don't know that they
actually had access to this uh supposed developer's machine um over the long term we you would expect
that if that's what happened then a full forensic analysis of any compromised endpoints you know employee
laptops and other machines should occur and they should then be able to figure out what is the actual root
cause of how it got compromised but generally what happens in these cases especially with lazarus group
uh you know they are considered uh very advanced persistent threat actors and they will spend weeks
if not months uh poking and prodding and trying to social engineer and compromise various employees at
a company in order to eventually get production infrastructure access so that usually does involve some sort of social
engineering to trick an employee into installing some sort of software that has a malicious payload
what we've seen pretty often is that they will go after developers and in some cases they will
they will try to get the developers to download and run you know some sort of code from github
usually under the auspice of helping them debug something or helping them do some sort of you know academic
project and that code and that github project will have a malicious uh zero day like exploit that
basically allows them to get your full access to the machine gotcha gotcha no it's it's it's very
interesting by the way we're about to break 1 000 live viewers on the live show if you guys are enjoying
simply bitcoin live so far make sure to smash that like button help us break 100 likes within the first 15
minutes of the show on youtube we're already at 80 likes if you guys are enjoying the show smash the like button
consider subscribing opti crazy morning man the day that jameson lop is joining us on the show we had to put out
some fires in a very short amount of time but i'm happy that we got the show uh up and running for you guys
uh what are your thoughts on this man it was a pretty big deal it tanked the price as well man like i think it
it severely affected the price we were at like 99.5 i totally bought the top i always do no shame don't
care uh but uh but it like it it affected the price right it dumped the price i think a lot of people
had a lot of questions a lot of people are like wait a second hold on this dude is using a ledger
to sign a transaction for a 1.4 billion dollar transaction like what is going on here uh what
were your thoughts uh opti yeah well obviously when i saw that video of the ledger it was like wait
it's almost like the joke you've been saying for a long time that brian armstrong just has a ledger
in his sock drawer and that's how he secures the coinbase transaction it like literally happened with
bybit so that that was just hilarious uh and then just kind of in context you know this is a 1.4 that
article said about 1.5 i think it's like 1.45 billion dollar hack uh obviously it's an ethereum
but in context this is what about three times the size of the mt uh you know mt gox going down so
this is a huge huge hack here the lazarus group obviously came up huge on this hack whether it was
social engineering or what have you it's a huge hack and then before i actually have a question for a lot
before but uh it's kind of what you pointed out nico like it's funny and i was joking about this
earlier while we're kind of setting up the show it's funny that even the real scammers out there
don't even want ethereum or any coin and they just flip it into bitcoin instantly and try to get it into
bitcoin you know a signal for everyone out there that might be bitcoin adjacent it's like even the
real scammers don't want the the the coin scams they're like let's put it into bitcoin but uh a lot
for you know for the not so advanced people in the audience um with this hack just to be completely
clear is this uh an ethereum issue or ledger issue can this happen on bitcoin for someone watching the
show right now you know maybe they're getting a little a little scared if their bitcoin is secured
correctly what would be your advice to them i mean it's a combination of the complexity of some of
these protocols um and just the way that these hardware devices operate so um you know i think the
takeaway here is you know multi-sig is not a panacea uh you know having your keys offline obviously is a good
start but the real question is you know when you're actually cryptographically signing a transaction to
move funds how strongly are you verifying exactly what you're signing and so the problem here is that
uh in most cases when people are doing multi-sig transactions on these evm networks they're blind signing
because as i said the the hardware simply doesn't have enough information to know exactly what the
result of the command that you are signing is is going to do to you know that network to that blockchain
so you have to have more safeguards in place you have to have more levels of verification if you are
using a um we could call it a non-native multi-sig contract like the nice thing about bitcoin is that
multi-sig is baked into the protocol it is it's very simple um the the downside to these you know more
generic smart contracting networks is they don't have multi-sig baked into the protocol it ends up being a
you know much more complicated you know app if you will that is written and deployed onto these networks
and as a result those hardware devices simply just don't know what to do with it the one thing that
we're seeing your ledger is talking about well no one should be doing blind signing they should be doing
clear signing and what does that actually mean well it basically means ledger wants you to be using their
enterprise product where they have you know a very specific set of smart contracts that their servers
are aware of and then they have additional sets of interactions between your uh ledger live app
software that you're running and then the servers on their back end where it's doing just additional
levels of verification back and forth and sending data to your ledger device so that the ledger
can display exactly what it expects the result to be so you know this is still additional complexity
but i think it's really is the best that we have to offer at this point in time and you know we've
done similar things at casa where it's it's you know a client and server uh validation basically checking
each other's work the problem that occurred here with this gnosis safe front end is that everything
was happening in the browser like there was no other machine uh you know no other full node that was
running somewhere that was basically being checked against to see exactly what the result of the
transaction was going to be got it interesting so essentially and and that's that's actually so
multi-sig is built natively into bitcoin but with the alternative with the altcoins it's not built natively
into them so they have to do it via smart contract and essentially that's where it it uh opens the attack
vector so to speak right um and someone in the chat i think the complexity and i just want to share this
um i just want to share this screen from uh from the by bit fitter uh by bit ceo um and it exactly says
what what lop was saying so the benign uh javascript file of app.safe.global appears to have been replaced
with malicious code on february 19 2025 specifically targeting ethereum multi-sig cold wallet of by bit
the attack was designed to activate during the next by bit transaction which occurred on february 21st 2025.
so this is extremely sophisticated lop like these guys this is not child's play like they knew
exactly what they were doing well they did because if they had wanted to they could have been sweeping
basically everybody's wallets who were using the uh gnosis safe web app but you know they were smart and
they put in that conditional that basically only listed a couple of contract addresses because they
didn't want to tip their hand like this is sort of a classic game theory of a zero day exploit when you
have some sort of massive vulnerability that you're trying to monetize do you immediately start you're
trying to sweep up money from everybody or do you have a little bit of patience and you basically lie in
wait until the big whale comes along and so that's what happened here is like they knew that like that
was the biggest possible wallet uh that was going to be interacting with this code and so they only had
to wait a couple of days to basically get the the fish on the hook so to speak if they had deployed it
without those conditionals then you know you probably would have had people losing a a few eth here and
there and they would have raised the alarm because they wouldn't have understood what happened and then you
know that would have resulted in the gnosis team looking into it and finding the problem before
they were able to get the 1.4 billion yeah wow it's so wow wow wow very sophisticated is a the the lazarus
group uh very sophisticated target uh you know just lying in wait until they get the big pot now my question
to you lop and i think a lot of people are watching this um how do people protect themselves from this
like i mean from my stance uh vantage point it's like okay obviously take self-custody bitcoin you know uh
the simpler the better right in my opinion so uh what would your professional advice you've been around for a
very long time in this space um you're obviously you know this is up your alley right you're a security i
would consider you a security expert uh how could people protect themselves um from this type of attack
well yeah i mean if you stick to bitcoin and you uh are using these air-gapped hardware devices to
verify the transaction details on the device then you're going to be good to go it's not until you
start dealing with these more complex protocols where you're basically doing you know smart contract
commands where you need to have a more sophisticated setup so um you know if you are going to go down the
route where you're using evm stuff um you can you can simply avoid using these uh smart contracts and
you can just use the native you know single signature on chain uh functionality and in those cases your
hardware devices will be able to display exactly you know what the amounts and destination addresses of
your transactions will be but you know if you have millions or tens of millions or hundreds of millions
of dollars uh you basically need to have a much more sophisticated setup that's managed by a team
and you know you really need to be paying a number of different security professionals to try
to break your setup and find the weaknesses in it um it needs to be a lot more sophisticated than just
using a web app yeah i 100 agree and i think that's where you know it perhaps it gives it gave them
a false sense of security right they're like oh we're using multi-sig this is fine
you know oh i i'm i'm looking at like this is something that i've done over and over and over
again but that's exactly what the social engineering attack like this is what they they rely they they
hope that you kind of uh fall into this convenience trap this oh i'm safe my my setup is safe and uh you
know they they pounce on the the opportunity not to mention it was a massive honeypot because you know if
if the if the reward wasn't so great you know i don't think they would have gone through the amount
of effort like i'm just reading this report and in my mind i'm telling i'm thinking to myself i'm like
this must have taken months and months and months of planning and just checking and seeing until you
know they found a vulnerability this was not something simple it wasn't like the the bitfinex hack which was
a total social social engineering hack uh attack this was like a sophisticated like black hat hacker type
of you know uh operation though we still really don't know the details of the bitfinex hack and that's
always been disconcerting like they never really revealed uh you know how the machines got compromised
like how how did ilia get uh production infrastructure access to the bitfinex there's still so many open
questions and i'm afraid at this point we're never going to get all of the answers to that but yeah so
you know some of the people that have been concerned about this have basically been saying well you know
if a if a multi-billion dollar exchange can't do self-custody correctly then how do i know that i can
well you know first of all you probably don't have a billion dollars that you're trying to custody like
you're not at the same level of uh of threats that you have against you so you know north korea isn't
going to be sending their hacker squad after you for your you know few thousand dollars or even probably
for a million dollars they are going after those uh multi hundred million and billion dollar targets
you know their time and resources are precious so they're going to go after the big boys
um beyond that you know part of part of the just mile high aspect of uh security in this ecosystem is
we need to stop creating such huge targets and the way that you do that is you get as many people as
possible to take their bitcoin into self-custody if you're if the you know the culture is not pushing
people to educate themselves and to learn and take the responsibility of self-custody then and the
inevitable outcome is the vast majority of people have all of their money in just a handful of trusted
third parties and those are going to be the targets for these state level actors who as you said are
very advanced and persistent and they will spend months and huge amounts of resources because they
are backed by a nation state and they only have to find you know one weakness they only have to win
they only have to like succeed one time in order to have massive catastrophic consequences for many
people and and as as we've seen you know the consequences here actually affect everyone uh in
a way even the self-custody folks because whenever a attacker manages to get their hands on millions or
billions of dollars worth of crypto assets what are they going to do they're going to try to dump it as
quickly as possible you know first they're going to uh try to you know move it around to make it harder
for anyone to try to confiscate uh you know i think one of the reasons that they started hopping
to other chains was because there was a little bit of rumbling about well maybe we could you know
roll back ethereum or you know make a state change to ethereum but of course once they start
moving to other chains that becomes uh practically impossible and feasible to get consensus to do
but the ultimate medium term goal of course is for them to get out of the entire crypto ecosystem and
and basically convert it into fiat so that they can fund you know whatever their nation state programs
are you know some some people speculate that this is going to uh funding like north korean military
programs i don't know how much evidence we have of exactly where the money is going but you know it's
probably nothing good yeah absolutely and and uh one of the thing did uh i found it interesting that
they converted the eth to bitcoin right uh i found that interesting and then um you know it's it's uh
let's see what happens because a lot of i saw i saw a lot of people were talking about it how like
they weren't because all these addresses were being followed they weren't going to be able to
do anything with that stuff but apparently that's not the case it doesn't look like
the lazarus group or any of these you know any of these hackers have any intention of giving that money
back um so yeah that's that's the way it is anyhow anyways guys before we move on to the next segment
of the show we're going to talk we're going to be talking about the rise of five dollar wrench attacks
all over the world and what you can do to protect yourself also lop wrote an article that uh jack dorsey
is not satoshi nakamoto uh apparently that has been making the rounds on x uh that jack dorsey is satoshi
nakamoto i mean i could have told you that i could have said you know like that you know i have my
suspicions i'll never say them publicly but jack dorsey is not and it wasn't is not on that list um but uh
yeah so we're going to be talking about that of course and then during the culture segment we're
going to be talking about casa casa makes self-custody easy it lets you uh take all the advantages of
multi-sig uh but the ui makes it incredibly easy for anyone who doesn't have experience with bitcoin
multi-sig uh it allows it allows it for anyone to just pick it up and get all the benefits of security
without the complexity of very sophisticated uh you know uh apps and ui and all that stuff casa
makes it incredibly easy to to do all that so we're going to be talking about that during the culture
segment it's going to be an incredible show guys if you guys are enjoying it so far we already broke 100
likes on youtube help us break 200 likes we're almost on four we're almost at 400 live viewers on youtube
alone and 1500 live viewers across all platforms and of course shout out to the rumble audience which has
by far the most savage chat of everyone the rubble audience i feel like hits us with the metaphoric
two by four every single day non-stop so guys it's going to be a great show before we jump into it i do
want to give a very special shout out of course to simply bitcoin's lead sponsor simply bitcoin would
not be possible without our partners and we're very very we're very picky on who we choose to partner with
bitcoin well enable your independence with the fastest and safest way to buy bitcoin on chain
or via the lightning network in canada and the usa to get started you put in your email address
it takes two to five minutes to get signed up and what makes bitcoin well different is that it's a
completely non-custodial platform what does that mean that means that when you buy bitcoin on bitcoin well
as soon as the funds clear they go straight to your self-custody bitcoin wallet address they don't even
allow you the ability to leave your bitcoin on the exchange which of course perfectly aligns with the
simply bitcoin ethos the separation of money and state because self-custody is the revolution also
if you're a higher net worth individual looking to buy fifty thousand dollars worth of bitcoin or more
check out bitcoin well infinite it's a white glove experience you get a dedicated rep which you can
call or you can text you can do email and every time you want to buy or sell bitcoin you have a real
human being that you can interact with so check out bitcoin well infinite today go to bitcoinwell.com
to get started and now if you're an american you can get paid in bitcoin sent directly to your personal
bitcoin wallet share your bitcoin well direct deposit details with your employer set your bitcoin slash
dollar split and receive stats instead of fiat with every paycheck what are you waiting for head
over to bitcoinwell.com today scan the qr code use promo code simply btc get three tosses into the bitcoin
wishing well guys we're gonna hit the numbers we'll be right back
i want to tell you guys about our sponsor stamp seed is your bitcoin and cold storage really secure
are your seed words really secure stamp seeds do it yourself kit has everything you'll need to hammer
your seed words into commercial grade titanium plates instead of writing them down on paper don't do that
paper sucks you want to literally stamp your seed into this plate of titanium your words are actually
stamped into the metal plate with this hammer so once your words are in they aren't going anywhere
no risk of the plate breaking apart and your pieces falling everywhere titanium stamp seeds will survive
nearly triple the heat produced by a house fire they are also crush proof waterproof non-corrosive and most
importantly because this is generational wealth time proof all things that paper is not allowing you
to hodl your bitcoin for the long haul i mean here is the plate that they crushed they put in water they put a
blowtorch to it and as you can see the words have survived stamp your seed on stamp seed and you can use promo
code simply to get 15 off anything on their store head over to stamp seed.com today
all right everybody could you imagine that conversation many generations i mean like 50 years from now and
your grandchildren are looking at you and they're saying grandpapa are you gonna are you gonna give me
your bitcoin and you look at them in their eyes and you say no because i wrote down my seed phrase on paper
don't do that stamp your seed phrase onto titanium go to stamp seed.com today use promo code simply 15 off
at the time of recording the bitcoin price is 84 750 block height that's at a discount 22
discount specifically block height 885 590 sats per dollar 1180 market cap 1.68 trillion bitcoin
versus gold market cap 8.3 percentage issued 94.42 decline from all-time high negative 22.4
realized monetary inflation 0.97 percent in the grand scheme of things we're just getting started
i love this number when me and opti started covering this i believe it was at like the two percent level
it's now below one percent bitcoin's realized monetary inflation continuing to take fiat currencies to
absolute school and if you buy bitcoin right now you're getting it at a 22.4 discount big of a bit of a
dip anyways i do want to focus on this uh because i think uh our friends over at casa do such a great
job um making multi-sig easy making your bitcoin self-custody set up extremely secure uh and a lot
of people think that uh you know maybe the wrong episode to say this but i'm going to say this anyways
um but a lot of people think that the the biggest vulnerability is their bitcoin being hacked right
and there's a bitcoin being hacked like that's their biggest vulnerability that's what they think
um but in reality the biggest vulnerabilities to your bitcoin are two things uh you either losing
the ability to access your bitcoin because you made your setup way too sophisticated and you just don't
have the technical know-how so you lose your bitcoin yourself and then the other which is the more
physical type of attack which is the infamous five dollar wrench attack and it seems like those types of
attacks have been escalating uh over time and perfect we have the the what i consider the master of
bitcoin security on the show today jameson lop to talk about all of this so first starting off with
this article article a chinese man has been i can't say that on youtube uh a chinese man has been uh taken
out on the southern south korean island of jiju and what appears to be a cryptocurrency robbery
uh here's another one an in-depth news report on one of the attackers evolved in the dan barry
kidnapping attempt last year that was linked to a several hundred million dollar bitcoin heist
uh here is the next one six men are accused of kidnapping three family members and a nanny from a
chicago townhouse in october and forcing them to transfer 15 million dollars in cryptocurrency before
releasing them five days later and last but not least a specific type of worker named zapri outlaw is
charged with kidnapping a man she met at a las vegas nightclub taking nearly 300 000 in cryptocurrency from
him the victim might have been uh under the influence of something so anyways uh lop this seems to be
happening seems to be escalating i think a lot of things uh there's trade-offs obviously with self-custody
self-custody comes with personal responsibility comes with responsible complete responsibility there is
no 1-800 number to call uh if you've lost your keys right um and it also i think potentially opens you up
to a uh you know the infamous five dollar wrench attack right uh you know like everyone's thinking
like oh it's going to be this sophisticated lazarus group but in reality you buy a five dollar wrench and
you show up at someone's house and you say i'm not going to leave until you give me your bitcoin uh and if
not i'm going to use this five dollar wrench in ways that you don't like right so lop like obviously
you know you've been doing a great job covering all these events that have been happening worldwide but
first thing that sticks out to me is one happened in chicago so one happened actually in the united states
uh which you would think in the united states that these types of things weren't happening
um you that you've been covering this for so long is this surprising at all um i think what we're seeing
is that um just because you live in a safe area doesn't mean that you're safe from being targeted
like these are highly specific highly targeted attacks well some of them are right so i guess we
we need to break down the different types of attacks right so first of all there's the like
the crime of opportunity um and so i think the the one with the uh as you said specific type of worker
um you know that that sounded more like a crime of opportunity this guy was probably going out putting
himself in a risky situation he was probably flaunting his wealth or talking about how he was doing a lot of
crypto trading stuff and so that got him targeted just in the moment uh now i think the things that
people should be more worried about uh because they're harder to protect against are the ones where
it's a home invasion type thing where you're getting targeted ahead of time and you know these people
uh these attackers are putting a lot of effort into you know surveilling you figuring out what your
sort of day-to-day activities are and then essentially taking you hostage and maybe they do that at your
house if they feel like your house is not a hard target or in other cases like last year we saw a ceo
of wonderfully in toronto they just waited for him to exit his office at the end of the day and they
threw him into a van uh when he came out into the parking garage uh going home from work so they were
likely surveilling him and figured hey that's the the most vulnerable time for us to pick him up so um you
know i would say in general these are still rare like in in the greater context of how many million people
obviously uh are owners of bitcoin but we also see the trend and the trend is that there seems to be a
rough correlation between the exchange rates you know the general adoption and understanding or awareness
of bitcoin and the number of criminals who are then trying to apply their own skill sets in extracting
these valuable assets from targets that are probably uh not nearly as hard as you know trying to hit
like uh an armored car or a bank or you know traditional uh high value target
oh sorry about that and let me ask you something else slop right so you broke it down on the specific
types of attacks there's the opportunistic attack right with that specific type of worker that i said
youtube um and then there's the uh there's the planned attack it seems like that chicago attack
that that seems like a pretty big heist 15 million that seems like a planned attack that seems like
they they scouted that person out now my question to you lop and you've written amazing articles on this
by the way um how do you protect yourself against this like you know how do you how do you go about your life
you know rethinking your your safety and your family's safety right because us bitcoiners we have this
joke of like look i love the second amendment and i'm gonna make my house into an effing castle
um so you know like what what would be the the uh the what would be the advice to someone that potentially
is you know they've been in bitcoin for a while they have they take self custody but they they haven't
really thought about this potential attack vector what would your advice be to them
i mean the first thing is don't be an idiot don't put yourself into risky situations you know don't go
conducting high value face-to-face trades with large amounts of of cash um involved um because you know
that's where a lot of these crimes of semi-opportunity happen uh is people targeting the sort of face-to-face
otc traders getting them to meet up in a sort of secluded hotel room or something like that and then
uh basically taking them hostage tying them up and uh only performing one half of the trade as it were
uh but for the the more like long-term targeted stuff with the home invasions and robberies and whatnot
the the main thing that you want to focus on is not becoming a target and how do you not become a
target uh well you shut up uh you don't go around you know flaunting wealth you don't broadcast to the
entire internet that you're doing stuff uh with these assets and uh preferably if if it's too late for you
if you've already basically doxed yourself uh as being you know bitcoin evangelist and holder
then you should take precautions so that it's hard to actually find your address where you sleep at night
that's what i did a number of years ago it's it's not easy but it's feasible at least in the united states
it can be more difficult in other countries that don't have you know some of the same legal options
for you know protecting your address and your ownership of property and stuff but privacy i would
say is the thing that people should be investing in the most um you think of you know any security system
should be this multi-layered system so you've got your valuable thing that you're protecting at the center
and then you're sort of rain fencing it with multiple layers of security you never want to
only have one layer of security you should assume that various security mechanisms are going to get
broken through but at the outermost layer beyond the actual security is your privacy and that privacy
layer is very important because if you have strong privacy you're not going to get targeted in the first
place and you're not going to have to worry about whether or not your various layers of
security are going to fail so you know i do hear people of course
basically saying oh i don't have to worry about this because i have guns and so on and so forth
and look i'm a big firearm owner myself there's plenty of photos and videos of me with guns uh on the
internet and um you know if it gets to that point then you uh are in trouble like it means that all of your
other uh privacy and security mechanisms have failed and now you're in a sort of last ditch effort to
really fight for your life and of course there are plenty of things that can go wrong and simply having
a gun uh is not a guarantee that it will be successfully used to defend yourself i think across the over 200
different um different incidents that i've measured only only two of them were successfully defended
with the firearm by the victim and why why do you think that is like is it just because you're again
they have a jump on you you don't have a jump on them yeah you can't be hyper vigilant all the time
like unless you're gonna go spend like a quarter million dollars a year for 24 7 you know around
the clock bodyguard security like nobody has eyes in the back of their heads and everybody has to sleep
at some point gotcha gotcha yeah it's a it's a it's a very interesting it's very interesting topic and
you know it's one of the trade-offs of of self-custody right um it's one something that i think bitcoiners
all have to really put some thought into but i agree with i agree with you lop 100 i think privacy
is just that's the easiest one right because if no one knows who you are there's nowhere to look
right um and then the also the go on podcast with your real name and face that would be a terrible
a terrible idea um and also uh opti did that for a while no i didn't you're lying you put uh you put
you put on a mask for a while oh yeah oh yeah yeah i wasn't on forever and then nico
wrote me into not being a non so now i'm wrecked thank you nico
but uh but hey someone has someone has to talk about bitcoin someone someone you have to do it
right uh but yeah this is uh this is a very very fascinating topic very interesting topic lop if people
want to go down the rabbit hole and read some of your articles where could they find them
yeah check out blog.lop.net i've got a lot of privacy articles there and uh in general if you
want to go down the privacy rabbit hole you should spend the uh like 40 or 50 bucks to buy extreme
privacy by michael bezell on amazon awesome awesome so you go we have it in the ticker down below blog.lop.net
and uh check out some of lops articles they're some of my favorite i've been reading them for years
um there's one there's one with an image of of just like a moat around a house uh which it was
one of my favorite articles so yeah just go check out all this stuff this is all stuff guys that you
have to think about if you're taking bitcoin into self-custody especially you've been in bitcoin for
a while these are all things that you have to think about um think about multi-sig think about geographically
separating your seed phrases think about decoy wallets those are all things that could work to your
advantages uh to your advantage but you have to you have to put in the thought you know uh
the the spider-man quote is ringing in my head right with great power comes great responsibility
and that's what self-custody is all about anyways guys we're going to jump into the news segment uh
where we're going to be talking about whether jack dorsey is satoshi nakamoto or not so we will be right
back i want to give a shout out to our sponsor casa bitcoin security matters but managing private

about this gentleman right here jack dorsey which lot believes is satoshi nakamoto no just kidding that's
a joke uh blop you dropped this article on your blog blog.lop.net uh the title of
the audio the title the title of the article for the audio listeners is jack dorsey is not satoshi nakamoto
uh a compilation of evidence that jack dorsey could not be the creator of bitcoin so let's go through
some of that lately some folks have been pushing a half-baked narrative that jack is satoshi and you can
find the arguments here first one from sean murray why jack dorsey is satoshi nakamoto jack dorsey was
one out of the 1 300 confirmed cyber puns in 1996 in his umr email wore an adam back t-shirt in the umr
yearbook umr students were called miners was a computer science and math major with an interest
in crypto it continues to go um anyways you guys get the point back to lops blog uh and here this is
matthew seagull he says in the spirit of full disclosure in intellectual honesty prosperity's judgment and
rigorous debate i would like to share my strong belief i have become personally convinced that jack dorsey ceo of
the square and the square and founder of x is bitcoin's founder satoshi nakamoto and he posted
this was april this is february 18th this was february 15th wow okay this is all coming
all all around the same time but you know um and lop says here we go again 2014 we found satoshi
turns out he was hiding in plain sight and we listed in the phone book 2025 we found satoshi turns
out he was hiding in plain sight and appearing on national television wearing a satoshi shirt i have
to play the meme here we go anyway it continues to say it's true that jack was a cyberpunk and a
programmer but that's the strongest evidence available to support the this theory everything
else is circumstantial if not outright mental gymnastics via numerology i will once again point
out that satoshi hunting is a dick move and thus i once again find myself interested in discrediting
said dicks if you're going to post a satoshi claim you should put as much effort into trying to disprove
your own thesis as you do trying to improve it otherwise you risk looking like a fool accusing
someone of being satoshi without providing bulletproof evidence makes you a massive because you're painting a
target on them it continues to say the funny thing about jack is that unlike most cyberpunks he was
an extremely public individual who posted who who posted what he was up to on nearly an hourly basis during
2009 and 2010 jack posted over 6 200 tweets this gives us a much larger data set to work with
uh compared to satoshi who created fewer than 1 000 timestamp events during the same period
a little common sense during that time period of 2009 and 2010 jack dorsey was not only chairman
of the board of twitter but also the ceo of the fledgling startup square it's quite clear that he
was an extremely busy person not only oversight overseeing multiple companies but traveling around
the world meeting important people doing press conferences speaking at conferences and promoting
philanthropic causes and more his activities do not fit the profile of someone who had the time and mental
bandwidth to also be did we lose nico it seems like it okay okay oh wait he's back oh did did i drop out
yeah for a second you're back you're back what what part what part did i drop uh the persona part oh okay
all right perfect i mean so everything the little common sense all that okay anyways and so the my point here
about windows is that we know satoshi was uh building on windows the first version was windows only
so i shouldn't clarify that yeah so uh lop first of all excellent article uh kind of debunking all of
this uh what you know what motivated you to do this i mean it's kind of a self-explanatory you feel like
these people are dicks why are they dicks for trying to expose satoshi nakamoto uh yeah i guess i leave that to the very end the the conclusion in which i basically say that look
uh satoshi should be an idea and a myth you know uh i think we are all satoshi you know satoshi left the project to us
uh the problem comes in when you try to paint satoshi as a singular figure of a human being you know a human being
is fragile as a single point of failure is going to be human they're going to have said or done probably
controversial things that people are going to dig into and try to use to basically cast aspersions upon the
entire bitcoin project so as a result i think bitcoin is stronger when there is no you know single human
point that people can basically try to uh denigrate 100 and i think that's something that bitcoiners
fundamentally understand i think if you've been in bitcoin long enough um you understand that it's
actually better that satoshi's identity is never discovered because if it is discovered it essentially
connects his identity to a mortal to a human being human beings have flaws right uh human beings you
know they have to sleep they have to do other things right they have to eat um but if if he remains this
mythological figure there's really no flaws there right you only have like you know uh certain interactions
that he's had i know in the uh csw lawsuit it was very interesting to to see some of uh some extra
communications that satoshi had that wasn't exposed to the public right so i i fundamentally agree i think
the less we know know about satoshi the better i think that if you've been in bitcoin long enough um
you've come to realize that no knowing the identity of satoshi is not important it's what satoshi did
is that is important um and i think it would be actually a negative to the industry and to the
movement because this is really what bitcoin is if we discovered his identity i don't think that's ever
going to happen by the way and i don't think those coins are ever going to move by the way also um i think
that he under he fundamentally understood that he created something bigger than himself and that's
why he walked away and left it to its own devices and here we are 16 years later and we're talking
about nation-state adoption and all that stuff so it's been a tremendous success so if you're look if
you're still trying to discover satoshi's identity uh you don't get bitcoin that's my take my maybe i'm
wrong but that that's my opinion uh opti what's your take on this brother yeah well i'm with lop on
this one i don't think jack dorsey is satoshi uh and i don't really need any any uh evidence for this it's
maybe it's just a vibe check here it just i does makes no sense to me and i i find it interesting though
part of this idea like you were saying nico if you are trying to find out who satoshi is you don't
understand bitcoin i find it interesting that usually for a lot of new people in bitcoin this
is like their one caveat this is the one thing that they always say that you know makes them not
trust bitcoin and us bitcoiners are completely opposite it's like this is a good thing that
we don't know who satoshi is whereas most people come in it's like how could you trust this internet
money thing with an anonymous creator like don't you want to know who it is and i'm like no it doesn't
matter this is the beauty of it this is this is the whole point that the creator came anonymous gave
us a gift and disappeared like batman and this is why no one controls the network but an interesting
kind of take on this is that the those bitcoiners on twitter that are saying this they're not like
newbie bitcoiners and so i i find it kind of interesting that they are pushing this narrative
and i wonder what the incentive is and you know that's that's kind of my take on this it's like
it's not like they're new people into the space that are saying this they've been around for a
couple of years and now they're pushing this so that's what that's like the things that gets me
kind of wondering like what what is the incentive to push that jack dorsey is satoshi but yeah like i said
it's it's usually newer people in the space that come in and they wonder who satoshi is and all of us
here that been around for a while we're like dude it doesn't matter i don't care i literally don't
care i don't ever want to know i hope he never comes out but it's funny that when new people come in
they always ask the same questions like how could you trust this money you don't even know what
created i'm like this is a good thing what are you talking about do you even understand what's going
on here i think that uh some people just want to have a hero or a leader figure and that you know it
would be cool if satoshi happened to also be this guy who's a billionaire and one of the richest people
outside of the bitcoin uh the satoshi mind i think that's a similar reason why some people have floated the
elon musk theory which is you know similarly ridiculous but um you know people come in and i
think they want to know who satoshi is because they think that there might be a backdoor in the code
you know satoshi could be the nsa or the cia and it doesn't matter because we know what the code does
we can look at it it's open source it's been reviewed by countless individuals who have tried
to find weaknesses in it for 15 years now and then i think some other people are slightly worried about
the economics aspect of you know one person controlling such a large portion of the supply
and i tend to agree with nico that the coins are never going to move i have a blog post a few years
ago entitled satoshi was not a greedy miner in which i go into the really deep technical details of
satoshi's mining operation and i show that they actually mined a lot slower than they could have
and so my thesis or satoshi's mining operation is that it was never meant to accumulate coins it was really
meant to act as a heartbeat for the network and you can actually see that satoshi would stop mining for
five minutes after finding a block to basically give the rest of the world a chance to try to find a
block and then over the the years satoshi actually decreased their hash rate as the hash rate of the
rest of that network increased and so that that was because they no longer needed to be that stabilizing
force to ensure that blocks were still being produced at a consistent rate in those very early days
100 no and and he was uh and i remember some of the earlier uh earlier communications lob to add to your
point he was like basically saying like guys like calm you know like let's make sure that this hash is
distributed right like let's calm down because in the beginning it was it was it was very delicate you
you could you can even make an argument that it was it was centralized lap isn't there a story that
essentially satoshi ran bitcoin and stealth in the for like kind of like in the very very early days
on purpose uh i'm not sure what you mean by stealth i mean he was running he was running the software by
uh no like there were other early miners uh even in the first you know day or so of blocks if i recall
correctly there was actually some logic in the bitcoin client at the time uh where it would not start
mining blocks until there was at least some other peer connected to the node interesting so he so someone
else had to is is that i don't want to ask what that person is but i mean like like some of these
people are fake are public are they not yes we do know some of the very early miners and then there are
plenty of those early blocks that as far as we know have not been attributed to any specific identity
yeah those guys they're doing it right they're doing it right they're watching all this content they're
going to the conferences they they're not going to the conferences no they might you have no idea you
would have no idea right anyways all right hey wait nico before we go on since we got lop here uh
spongebob squarepants in the chat has a question here and i think lops perfect perfect person to add
why hasn't satoshi's wallet's been hacked well the keys might have been destroyed i think there's
there's plenty of reason to believe why the keys are no longer laying around uh like i said
you know my takeaway from looking into satoshi's mining activities was that it was actually a very
specialized machine with it was running um specialized multi-threaded mining software that was not like
public open source mining software was not the software that was built into the bitcoin client at
the time and so that's you know another reason why i believe that satoshi basically just had that
infrastructure running to keep the network going for those first 18 months to 24 months and then once
the network seemed like it had bootstrapped itself uh they turned it off so you know what happened to
those keys um maybe they destroyed them um maybe they still exist but i think it's basically there
that money is like too hot like i don't know how you would actually spend any of that money without
putting yourself at extreme risk of of being doxed 100 i 100 agree with that i do i do before we move on to
next segment i do want to uh end or you know finish off some of the reasons as to why jack dorsey is
not satoshi and lop uh lined it up there lined it up here because i'm sure jack used windows at some
point in his life but he has been a die-hard apple fan ever since the original iphone came out
and it says can't use my computer because both my magic track pack and keyboard are out of batteries and
it says most of the evidence in this report is based upon time stamps meets based activities jack
was bi-coastal in 2009 and 2010 frequently alternating between san francisco and new york
because those are the locations of twitter hq um and then i think this is the most interesting one right
here i think out of out of the things that you've posted lop this to me is i mean like unless satoshi
could be two places at the same time like i feel like jack dorsey just planning all of this um you
know but anyways so satoshi's public activity hour of the day and then here is jack dorsey's uh
uh public jack dorsey's tweets hour of the day obviously he needs to be awake to tweet i mean
i mean i don't know lop he could be this sophisticated shadow coder and be planning his tweets
yeah technically like any activity can be automated right uh but you know you kind of have to go with
the occam's razor on yes like is the more complicated question or answer to it really the more likely one
i think i have a question for you lop like it seems like uh satoshi based on this what seems like he was on
the eat and u.s time zone uh yeah uh it really lines up well with what you would consider to be a
typical waking and sleeping schedule of someone on the pacific time zone interesting oh very very okay
all right everybody we're going to move on to the culture segment we have uh tons we have tons to cover
and tons to talk about we're going to be talking about casa it makes multi-sig easy it makes self-custody
easy there's an app that i've been recommending to friends and family because i want them to have all
the benefits of taking self-custody but also uh not losing their keys yeah i don't know how many times
i've found myself in this situation where either you know just family members of mine they're like nico
i lost my seed phrase i'm like don't worry we can just replace it right um so the casa app enables
that makes it easy so we're going to talk about all of that we're going to hit the culture segment we
will be right back i want to give a shout out to our sponsor hive digital technologies as the first

have jameson lopp here in the house joining us today on simply bitcoin live jameson is the cto of casa jameson
quick elevator pitch if you had one minute in an elevator with someone and they're like jameson
what is this casa thing how would you describe it uh so basically we help you be your own bank and
we make it easy to do so because you know when you are setting up essentially your own bank security
there's many many different decisions to be made many best practices to be followed and if you're
not deep into the weeds of all of that then it's very helpful to have software that basically guides
you down following best practices and to have actual humans that you can talk to who can help you understand
the trade-offs of the different decisions that need to be made great and i love i love that phrase we
help you be your own bank that that's a very very powerful statement and and i agree i think you know
taking bitcoin into self custody especially with multi-sig and all the capabilities that that gives
you you feel like your own bank it's it's it's badass af uh opti do you have any questions before i move on
yeah definitely so when we were starting the show i asked lob what's the main message you want to get
across to our audience and lob said it very simply that we are fighting an uphill battle of convenience
when it comes to self-custody so can we elaborate on that for the audience i know our audience is pretty
much most of them are self-custody maximalists but we still see some people that are on the fence about
taking their bitcoin into personal custody yeah i mean beyond just you know our operations as a
company and this is a systemic issue for the entire ecosystem and my sort of black pill view of privacy and
security is that you know unfortunately human nature is to prioritize convenience at the expense of
almost everything else and we know that using a trusted third party to hold your money for you
is always going to be the most convenient thing basically pushing off all of the responsibility to
someone else is easy and we do that in many different aspects of our lives so it's basically
second nature to us so what we're trying to do is we're trying to make it as easy as possible reduce
as much friction as possible so that people can be more confident uh to take that responsibility
and uh we want people to be able to sleep at night with the understanding that you know they can do
self-custody without screwing it up and without having to worry that you know there's a weakness somewhere
or that you know one thing might go wrong and be catastrophic so that's everything that we're doing
is to put people into an architecture that eliminates single points of failure because
we understand things go wrong humans make mistakes and you don't want to be in a really brittle setup
where one thing going wrong results in you losing all of your assets
totally uh lot you've been in bitcoin for a long time you're a cyber security expert from your vantage
point from where we are today do you think self-custody or rather the idea of people self-custody do you
think that's going to improve or is this will this always be a niche idea for that at the like average
mainstream layman uh i i suspect that in relative terms uh you know as we go more mainstream that the
vast majority of adoption will happen through trusted third parties uh i think that's just the the reality
of the situation uh at least in our lifetimes um the problem here it really is i think cultural
and it and it's also it's a result of how human civilization has developed over millennia is that
uh we have created these economic powerhouses that have been able to leverage extreme uh efficiency
and performance gains through specialization of tasks and and so we've created these systems
where you're outsourcing the vast majority of the you know important aspects of your lives to third
party specialists because they're going to be better at doing something than you are if you had to do
everything yourself like this is why it's so much easier and efficient for us to go to the grocery store
than it is to grow our own food and slaughter our own animals um however while that's convenient and it's
efficient it is also um fragile it's it's creating all of these potential points of failure such that you know
if the supply chains for uh food and and delivery of important you know medicines and and other physical
items broke down you know we'd be in pretty dire straits within a week or two uh with the way that
modern society is architected so that similar thing basically trickles down to you know where we are with
self-custody uh you know people who have bank accounts are used to the idea of having all of their money in a trusted
third party who's managing for them and so this is as a result is kind of a cultural issue where
i suspect that it could take generations for us to kind of reverse course on that and uh really teach
our children and our grandchildren uh to take responsibility for some of these extremely important
aspects of their lives totally yeah i i very much agree that it's a culture issue now you did kind of
mention about businesses and bitcoin treasuries so as someone that is working on a bitcoin treasury
product how big of a product or a problem do you think that these honey pots are like coinbase and etc
in the in the space right now we know a lot of the bitcoin etfs are all custody essentially at the same
companies and obviously it's your kind of life motto here your life purpose is to obviously distribute that
security away from these honey pots so how big of an issue do you think this is and is this something
that you think you know that keeps you up at night do you think we might see another i don't know exchange
blow up like what what's your thoughts on that on that perspective well i mean look at what happened last
last week right like this is it's not stopping i mean we are we are improving security best practices but
security is a cat and mouse game it's a never-ending battle and so as this ecosystem continues to grow and
the total value of the ecosystem grows and then the total value of the single points of failure honeypot
custodians continues to grow then that means that the uh attackers are incentivized to spend even more
resources trying to find the weaknesses in them because the payoff of of a successful attack is also
growing so you know i think that in terms of risk it's just it's better to distribute risk across
millions of different points such that you know if if the average individual um has a failure and and
their self-custody gets successfully attacked yes it could be very bad for that individual but there's no
ripple effects across the rest of the ecosystem uh where you you don't have like one failure causing
hundreds of thousands or millions of people to lose their money instantaneously and then you don't
have the uh the economic pressure as we talked about earlier of you know a billion dollars worth of
liquidity uh trying to be extracted from the system as quickly as possible by the attackers so la we have
a we have a a it seems like we have a casa user in the chat uh so i don't know how to pronounce
that op do you want to give it a go psycho psycho psycho 05 says lop can we have foundation and cold
cards for signing devices i haven't used casa because we get sent treasures oh yeah uh we support both of
those devices and you know you can either buy them for yourself off the shelf or it really depends on
like which tier you're at i think we only really offer the customization uh of hardware at the private
clients tier if i recall correctly but uh you can you can definitely buy any of our supported devices
uh we support the cold card mark 4 and the q uh both seem to work pretty well as well as foundation
passport it just uh it depends on if you prefer doing the like a qr code based signing or not and that
can be a bit tricky i have you know several articles about um multi-sig performance testing of like
signing really large data size transactions yeah and and let me ask you something else lob so uh
maybe in in the chat this applies right and the reason that i love the casa product is again it makes
the whole self-custody aspect easy without sacrificing convenience and i think you guys have mastered the
ui your ui is incredible uh even has a little haptic tick to make you feel good when you sign something right
um so um and i think that makes it very easy for someone that perhaps is transitioning from the fiat
standard the fiat matrix to a bitcoin standard where they're taking self-custody and it kind of gives
them the same vibe of oh this is like a bank but it's not a bank because it's self-custody um so you guys
cover a lot of the complexities there what would your pitch be to someone like you know like hey look i
i already have a single sig and then i'm using you know i'm using a passport i'm using a cold card and
you know i'm on i have sparrow like you know why should i use casa
now look if you are comfortable with using the totally free tools that are out there then go for it um you
know nothing nothing that we do can't be replicated by someone if you put in enough time and effort to
do so and in fact like if you want to try to replicate uh everything that we've done i highly recommend
that you look up our wealth security protocol and that is uh several dozen pages explaining all of the
threats that we're trying to mitigate and exactly what steps that and decisions that we made in our
architecture to mitigate those threats um but really i think a lot of it comes down as i said earlier to
convenience uh to really providing a very simple user experience like we on purpose we do not offer a
lot of the more advanced functionality that you can do with bitcoin and that's because we think that
it's actually kind of dangerous you know it could be a foot gun uh in the hands of an unsophisticated
user so what we're trying to do is we're trying to build a super high security you know cold storage
setup that eliminates single points of failure and is accessible to a non-technical user that you may not
know all of the ins and outs of the protocol and security best practices and such so what you're
really doing is you're saving yourself a lot of effort of having to learn all of those best practices
and uh put them into place but it's certainly possible to do it yourself and you know i think
that's one of the great things about bitcoin like you don't need us uh to self-custody uh we're really
here to help you get into the best possible position as quickly and as easily as possible
100 and someone who uh it learning learn i learned self-cust it learned multi-sig specifically using
electrum and sparrow there's different standards people don't realize this right um if you don't
update your devices all of a sudden it's like wait a second oh my god i can't spend right there there's
there's a lot it's a very deep rabbit hole ladies and gentlemen um electrum crashes when you like
there's so many like you know um and that's what i love about casa is that you guys make this easy um
you guys make something that is highly complex uh easy to use for the everyday user um and of course
you guys offer support and all that stuff now uh my question to you lop is so you guys offer two of three
and a three of five uh what happened for anyone doesn't know so the two of three um you hold
uh the user holds two two of the three keys uh casa owns one or not owns but holds one key and then for
the three of five casa holds one key the user holds four one of the keys is on your phone which is backed up
to icloud or the google equivalent and then the the the rest of the three keys um
the the user uh the user holds now what's really interesting about the three of five is that it
actually feels like you're signing a two of three because the uh the phone key it's like a basically
it's like as soon as it's you know you you put in your phone password with your face or fingerprint
it like it signs automatically right uh so the experience is is very pleasant um in in my
experience uh and let me let me ask you something lob so what what happens if casa disappears you know
could could people still access their bitcoin like for whatever reason the app is pulled from the from
the app store you know uh something funky happens uh you know could people still sovereign recover their
bitcoin absolutely uh and because we're not doing anything proprietary here we're not doing
any sort of like proprietary multi-party computation or shamir secret sharing or anything like that we're
doing the you know native on-chain multi-sig which means that there are many other wallet software out
there that supports the same thing uh so you know we added wallet descriptor support last year that makes it
really easy to you know export and import the sort of uh skeleton you know descriptor of your wallet and
uh you know you can import that into like electrum or sparrow uh you know any any other wallet that
supports sort of arbitrary uh complex multi-sig setups and uh the first thing that actually happens when
you finish initializing your multi-sig vault with casa is that we send you instructions for what we call
sovereign recovery and that's basically you know if casa ceases to function or exist or or for whatever
is not working then uh you have the your step-by-step instructions for how to recreate your wallet and
spend your funds without ever relying upon our software or our infrastructure so i say this a lot but
what the primary point of casa is to eliminate single points of failure and that includes casa itself as
an organization yeah and you guys do a very good job at that because i've been in situations where and
i mentioned this earlier where um you know someone loses one of their keys on their multi-sig setup it's
incredibly easy to replace uh you just you press a button a little haptic makes you feel good about losing your
key sends you an email you plug in your new device and boom bomb bing you know you're you're you know
you're you know your wallet is is good to go um without that ui you don't know uh you the only way
you know is by trial and error um and it took me a while and you know sparrow wasn't around uh but so i
had to learn a lot of this stuff on electrum and i'm still an electrum junkie and i love electrum
um despite what people say okay it's a great wallet um but uh yeah it it you guys essentially
make a very sophisticated thing incredibly easy to use without sacrificing security um and it's
convenient for people that want to benefit from multi-sig but again don't have the technical capability
technical know-how to to to go down that now my question to you lop as well is um okay so
let's talk about geographically multi-sig geographically separated uh keys right because
i think that is incredibly important especially if you're using multi-sig uh could you talk a
little bit about that right keeping your keys in different locations and that obviously helps
protect you from uh you know five dollar wrench attack which we were talking earlier and there's
something that you've said in the past that really resonated with me and i've never forgotten um it it
will take an attacker just as much time to spend your bitcoin than it takes you to spend your bitcoin
and that's the way that you should be looking at it right so if it's if it takes you 10 minutes to
you know sign your bitcoin sign a transaction send your bitcoin out of cold storage in your mind the
back of your mind you'll be like it will take an attacker 10 minutes to send bitcoin whatever but if
you know that your multi-sig setup and your keys are geographically separated so it takes some couple
hours to go you know uh from place a to place b and etc etc then it becomes a little bit more complex
right and then it's not just uh you know let me just jump in here stay a couple hours now it's like oh
my god this might take a couple days obviously that raises the risk for the attacker himself
um so it's just a some some things to talk about so could you talk a little bit about that lop
geographically separated keys for multi-sig well yeah so the name of the game uh when it comes to
building the best possible multi-sig setup because multi-sig in and of itself is not panacea uh you know if
you keep all your keys at home then congratulations you've introduced a single point of failure to your
multi-sig setup um distributing the keys in as many different ways as possible is what gives you a great
strength and it actually it lets you leverage the benefit of what we call additive security it's it's
basically uh you know strength through diversity and this is diversity in a number of different things
you know you mentioned geographic diversity but also you want diversity of like what devices they're
stored on what are the physical security protocols around where each device is and basically you want
all of these things to be different because when something goes wrong you want that particular attack
or failure scenario to only affect one of your keys and not affect all of your keys and when you're in a
more of a um you know homogeneous setup then it's more likely that you have one weakness that could
potentially affect enough of your keys that either your money gets lost or stolen so you know having
geographic uh separation yes i mean it's it's obviously that's the way to protect against wrench attacks
but even more commonly it's just how you protect against natural disasters and you know things going
wrong like your house burning down we've had clients whose houses burned down we've had clients who
have been in flood zones and you know had various types of um catastrophic destruction to their primary
residents and so having you know keys in different geographic areas that are you know prone to different
types of um weather and natural disaster events gives you some improved robustness there if you want to
take it to the extreme um not just upon like wrench attacks but upon like nation state 6102 seizure style
attacks our most paranoid clients actually go to the extreme of distributing their keys uh in different
countries different jurisdictions uh that you do not play nicely with each other so that you know it's unlikely
for a 6102 attack to be able to reach across borders um and be able to uh you know force the turning over
of those keys that are you know outside of the reach of any given justice system yeah love the way guys
this is all things that you got to think about these are all things again with great power comes great
responsibility that's what self custody is all about casa makes it incredibly easy uh if you feel intimidated by
the the the tech stuff and i'm telling you someone who loves computers uh the trial and error that i had to end
the mini heart attacks no one tells you that right um the the trial and error of having to learn this stuff
uh was not a was not a a a walk in the park um so this is a great way uh to especially if if you hold a decent
amount of bitcoin you should definitely have it on multi-sig like i can't recommend that enough i think a single sig is
just like so it's a terrible idea in so many different is a single point of failure yeah right
there in the name yeah exactly so if you if you know you've been in bitcoin for a while i highly highly
recommend multi-sig and casa makes it incredibly incredibly easy without sacrificing security i want
to give a very special shout out to our guest today jameson lopp go check out his blog blog.lopp.net and of
course go check out casa go to casa.io slash simply of course today's show was february 27

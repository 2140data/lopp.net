the Web3 stage here and I have to say first off that is that burden has mainly
been borne by by Anastasia. It's a better-looking person sitting that way
whichever way it is. Very confusing. So just quickly without further ado, you know
we're very excited now to be in kind of year three and a half. We did 2017 and
back when we did 2017 I can remember actually being on a panel about AI and
having this sort of realization then and in the kind of breakout group and I
really want to recommend the breakout groups in Q&A sessions about the
connection between AI and should we say the Web3 movement and privacy
preservation and so forth and thinking about that quite specifically and then
we had from the year after that we had a more dedicated track to Web3 and I've
been working closely with the team since then. Now I think there's a lot going on
and it's going to be many more qualified people than me talking about these
topics that are kind of reverberating around the world at the moment but you
know it is fair to say one thought that I had at the weekend was that you know
that there are tribalistic tendencies that are innate to the human condition
that especially when you're dealing with people you don't know and and I think
those can obviously be brutal and horrific at times as we've been recently
seeing and my realization is that that actually because they're natural
although they can be overcome it's not a question of just fixing them it's a
question of being continuously vigilant for our behavior in the in that regard
and I think that applies to this question of how we treat other people but
it also applies to how we deal with other people in the context of trying to
solve problems and businesses and I think that Web3 gives us a chance to
really you know return to that more harmonious kind of village type setting
where you can trust each other intrinsically and collaborate but on
this unprecedented scale to address some really critical questions so I'm going
to turn it over to Anastasia to talk about the kind of program that we've got
teed up for you today thank you thank you Richard yeah well first to start
it's definitely been quite an experience organizing a 30,000 people conference
hats off to the technical team and to everyone who made it happen you guys are
definitely gonna experience hiccups I'm pretty sure we're pioneering here this
scope of a festival that has been brought online over a matter of a couple
of well I think five or six weeks so it's been a pretty exciting time
organizing this specifically I'm very thankful to speakers for handling this
many updates to the process I really applaud their the patience with us but
I'm really really excited to see what we're we've prepared and actually see
all of these sessions come to life today we have an incredible lineup of
speakers who are real leaders in each of their different fields across you know
across the board from artists to to writers to economists to web3 crypto
maximalists it's gonna be a pretty fascinating discussion I think you know
where we are today is we can see that our society is bleeding with inequality
with biases that are embedded in pretty much everything that we do our democracy
as we have seen now is suffocating under the pretense of emergency measures and
everything that's going on with things like the coronavirus we are experiencing
a major crumbling of our financial economy and financial system and and
probably most importantly the very planet that we're living in is really on
a scary trajectory at the same time as all of these things are happening we're
seeing this incredible progress being made in the web3 ecosystem where we
actually are developing technologies that can address some of these problems
we're developing technologies that help us make privacy something that is innate
to the systems that we're using and still allows to benefit from access to
different health monitoring technologies stress-resistant supply chains and you
know etc but we're also seeing technologies that emerge that allow us
to coordinate in better ways in ways that we have never been able to do
before to not just discuss stuff but to actually make things happen and take
action but the mission for the next three days is to put all of these
technologies all this amazing development into the context of what is
actually happening in the world and the problems that we're experiencing and
figure out how we can make the next 10 years better than the previous ones so
that's what we're excited to do here we're gonna have Samantha Yap moderate
the first day she will be the MC so you'll see a lot of her throughout the
day she's the founder and CEO of YAP Global and she's led a bunch of crypto
conferences before in the past she's been advising and helping build PR
strategies for a number of successful projects so you'll see her very shortly
but before we dive into that I'll pass on to Richard to share a couple of
highlights from the amazing people we'll hear from today. Thanks Anastasia and I
want to emphasize how much work that has gone in from particularly Anastasia to
make this happen and to get these some great topics and on the table here over
the coming days so you know we think about the type of challenge that you can
address with web3 there's been ones that are kind of in the long tail if you will
kind of where you know not the kind of core areas that it's kind of very
economic to address by applying a lot of resource or indeed not the core
areas where a couple of participants can get together and solve a problem but
rather areas where you require a lot of thinly spread data and a lot of thinly
spread actors to collaborate in order to do things in a kind of codified and
deterministic and and with the help of computers you know automated fashion I
mean so this you know encompasses everything from the decentralized
justice systems that are starting to emerge I guess you know arguably they're
probably still at the kind of dispute resolution stage but with my own
experiences of the law I'm optimistic they're going to be able to do a much
better job in time than the law has that's probably because my parents
also okay our parents are against the experience sorry no disrespect mom and
dad and then and then also another area which is it's incredible to think was
kind of being proposed by Andrew Yang and and also you obviously have the the
burn Bernie Sanders proposing some quite socialist policies in the US and
suddenly much perhaps not acknowledged even by the Republican Party in the US
we now find ourselves with a form of UBI in the US in response to the Kovac
crisis and and now we find ourselves absolutely in the requiring the white
heat of innovation in order to accelerate vaccine discovery in the face
of the crisis but also and we have I think some of the world's leading voices
assembled today just shortly and Anna States will introduce him we have James
Vincent the founder of founder we have Corey Doctorow the celebrated science
fiction author Benedict Evans formerly a partner at Andreessen Horvitz someone
I've been in awe of his abilities of synthesis and an insight and criticism
and critique for more than a decade now from his time at Enders and then at
Andreessen Horvitz and now fabulously back in in Europe and joined
entrepreneur first as a venture partner and Ilya Kushkin from NEAR
Protocol which is looking to actually should we say speed up alongside
Ethereum and pull up there and and perhaps be just as flourishing a
developer community as Ethereum is as we move into the next phase of Ethereum's
development and into this kind of polychain multi-chain future and we
also have I don't know they says you're gonna want to introduce you know the
speakers or would you I think I think we probably need to move on to James so
we'll we'll do the introduction and and then you guys will see everyone who
comes up next so the next person who's opening up the stage of the first
keynote will be James Vincent as Richard mentioned he's the founder of founder
and this is the person who helped shape and build the Apple brand over more
than a decade working hand-in-hand with Steve Jobs and then he went on to
advise founders of many other familiar brands like Airbnb and snap and so this
is gonna be an incredible discussion I hope you're all tuned in and we'll see
you soon thank you guys
all right hi good morning James Vincent speaking from actually
calling from Venice Beach California so it's 2 o 6 in the morning good morning
London good evening California I'm gonna talk today about building
consumer centric brands in an era really where I think it's fair to say that
technology is kind of outpaced the human condition I was lucky enough to to work
with Steve from 2002 actually with him till 2011 until his sad passing and then
2014 was I was with Apple so all the way through the sort of supercomputer in your
pocket from iPod and iTunes all the way through to the iPhone and so feeling
somewhat responsible for the introduction of all of that to the world
continued to try to do what I can to help brands mitigate bring the benefits
of help explain technology and I think there are some responsibilities there's
some clear opportunities for brands to fill those holes and I want to talk
about those today look it's really obvious you know the iPhone being the
the iconic product that does that but what it tends to do technology is it
really plays to efficiency convenience and speed and of course what we know
about those things even an app let's say the speed of efficiency is so it's as
as as short a point as possible as few taps as possible to getting to do what I
want to do and in that journey perhaps what we lose is some of the truth some
of humanity some of the empathy and connection that's so critical to our
interactions as humans be as human being so you know this is probably no no no
shock to most people on this call I think the challenge we're particularly
seen this in the US in the last few years but and a lot of the large
companies today's do seem more more inspired by economic progress and human
progress and I'm here to argue that there are brands and there are
opportunities for founders and companies to take a positive role and that those
companies actually have a huge upside when they do it right so I'm going to
talk about Apple I'm also going to talk about Airbnb snapchat and glossier just
for the younger millennial women amongst us this is a chart I've used for I don't
know how long with every founder I meet and everybody has a different answer to
the question when I say what got you here won't get you there they go wait
let me tell you it's actually just stolen from the marketing chasm which
is that famous marketing book from 20 30 years ago it's just that leap that you
have to make I think once you've gone from kind of a creation stage to a more
you know maybe maybe you've dominated a small niche you have some decisions to
make as you leap often this is the stage that we work with founders with
companies about what are their founding values what's what kind of company what
kind of dent in the universe as Steve would say is your intention to make and
it's it's our belief that the brands who are human centric make that leap and
and they make that leap to become sustainable businesses and it's not to
say that there of course on hundreds of companies that are not I just am here to
to and I think in in this time as we go further and further those brands that
are human centric are the ones that people look to follow the value systems
that they represent the social contract that they present is is you know an
incredibly positive one but there are also some responsibilities that come
with with doing that so I want to sort of highlight that through a little bit
of storytelling I'm gonna do and I'm gonna start with Apple of course
because that's the one that gets gets people interested Steve of course
wasn't about setting out to change the computer industry although of course he
did that rather well I don't think we even talk about it as a computer
industry but at some point of course it became something way more than that and
just simply technology that we use he set out to change the way people think
creatively and I'm sure that all of us have seen the various keynotes I can
absolutely hum the iPod keynote the iPhone keynote the iPad keynote actually
if you're ever thinking of introducing a product just go go look at those go look
at the thinking the way that guy's brain works in terms of how to get the sense
of the new with the familiar in the introduction of new technology I think
often times new technology new on top of new is always what Steve warned us
against and so he would always explain things through the lens of the familiar
and I think a lot of challenges with technology and tech people is that they
go new on top of new and people go I don't really understand that so few
people get to you but starting a conversation amongst the familiar is is
it is certainly a great way to move forward so I'm actually what is what I'm
gonna do I'm actually gonna give you a potted history it's I don't think this
appears in any other book or any book this is my version of the potted history
of the last 40 years building one of the world's most human centric brands and
there's a reason why I'm doing it this way it's really to highlight and it
wasn't kind of sequential in this way I don't think in 1984 Steve sat down and
said oh I must go do five chapters but he did some fairly seminal things that I
think created this sense that we all have which is this connection with this
brand called Apple and each time at every step he was very clear unintentional
about ensuring that that that people understood the relationship that you
have with Apple and so right back there in 1984 still thought of as one of the
best commercials ever made I don't claim any credit for being involved in that
but you know back in the day computers for the rest of us and I actually
happened to watch it yesterday showed it to my 14 year old son and he thought it
was pretty cool but Ridley Scott shot the commercial you have a very very
dystopian view of the future Blade Runner esque and this striking blonde
lady runs in with the red shorts and throws a hammer into the screen and says
you know the introduction of Macintosh will be the reason why 1984 won't be
like 1984 they defined their enemy and you know back in the day that was
definitely a fundamental part of making sure you know what kind of brand you are
which is to set yourself in relief to the the situation around you in 1984
there certainly were some I think IBM was the big bad guy back then but
setting a stall out very clearly defining your enemy what are you up
against and and where's that gonna take you and and then actually of course this
isn't a smooth path because in between times Steve gets thrown out of his own
country company runs off and creates Pixar happens to come back creates OS 10
which everyone's is clearly the savior of Apple because they've gone nowhere and
within six months calls shy day was the agency I work with and just before I
arrived and and and they they made a statement because they were pretty much
going bankrupt at the time and Steve Jobs called my colleague Lee Clow and
said can you come up I need you do some work with me it came up with a campaign
called think different which if 1984 isn't one of the best commercials ever
this is at least I think you know I've never seen this poster in so many
people's offices or not necessarily Einstein but one of the many crazy ones
crazy enough to change the world other ones that do you know fairly ballsy move
in 1997 when the company is pretty much bankrupt and he's paying money to put
this on to the Super Bowl and and just declare declare a notion of standing
out standing for something and of course using these incredibly celebrated
creative people to stand with them and to stand for what they stand for so
that's 97 I'm gonna flip to I arrived on the scene in 2000 and was involved in
the introduction of iTunes and iPod if you remember back in iTunes days the
record labels were suing 13 year olds for you using Napster that was their
radically modern solution to to things to the industry capitulating in Napster
and limewire people just assuming that music was going to be free forever and
Steve had this philosophy that I think if you bring people good solutions and you
charge them a reasonable price like an iPod that carries a thousand songs not
a CD Warpman that holds 12 and skips and and songs that are 99 cents each on
iTunes you can actually bring positive behavior back into a place that seemed
like it was going off into nowhere and artists were gonna be creating stuff for
absolutely nothing so a thousand songs in your pocket the silhouettes campaign
anybody that's seen those I haven't seen them for a while I think they still
stand up and they you know they were brought in the hardware the software
Steve's thought was always was always asking me where's the head where's the
heart in an idea the heart in the idea is the the visual of the person loving
the music and dancing and being completely lost in their music the
branding devices the ear pod wires which I still hold on to because I feel like
anyway sadly that was one of the things I brought to the world but everyone's
got ear pods now but for those people still wearing them thank you and a
thousand songs in your pocket was the was that I think the brief I wrote
actually ended up being the line at the bottom of the ad and you know it's it's
really that's the beginning of a super computer in your pocket very clearly
through the lens of music you know you start with a place that people connect
with it's it's simple but it's also kind of becoming the beginning of Apple
becoming a culture brand and before that it was a very on white site very techie
brand or or or kind of out there only for the you know the graphic designers
with long hair at the back of that the back of the office and of course now
everyone has a Mac and and an iPhone or many many people do speaking of Mac I'm
actually going to talk about step four as being and I just picked this out just
because I was so intimately involved in it but the Mac versus PC argument and
this again this is meant to be isn't meant to be the step five steps that all
brands must follow in order to become a humanistic human centric brand but this
just happens to be a good way to tell the story I remember Steve back in
whenever this was to that 2005 or something like that said we have 3%
market share that makes no sense we're not going to do that I want 90% market
share which if you ever spoke with Steve that seemed like a perfectly normal
suggestion actually this campaign of Mac versus PC which is just so simple was
based on this notion that there's 27 reasons why Macs are better than PCs but
how the hell do you put 27 reasons in advertising so you create a metaphor and
you you build a lot of humor into it and you pull them apart one by one by one by
one and you make sure that it's clear that you're better not just different
and in fact both so the 90% was actually the target was 90% of all computers over
$1,000 and that's indeed what they are today so I guess what I'm talking to
here is it's sort of an exposition or a product focus done in an apple-like way
to make a bigger point and then of course 2007 September 2007 delivering
the inevitable only because of the last 35 years and everything that led up to
it there's an app for that you know I'm pretty pretty confident a lot of the
platform upon which everything much of the particularly on mobile has been
crazy in the last 13 years was on them was on the premise of an app and the
the notion of an app so there's an app for that there's an app for this is not
for just about anything on the iPhone was a phrase I think again written as a
brief written as an idea turned into a campaign turned into a reality of so
many businesses now built on the platform of this technology so I think
what you see through these five steps is the the building of a brand through
product defining in this way and I can give you some other examples where the
brand gets defined in some other ways but here defining your enemy standing
for something and then the next three are you know iPod Mac and phone but
signaling showing being somewhat didactic in explaining and delivering the
inevitable I'm gonna give you a couple of other examples just so so that we
broaden the aperture a little bit so after Steve passed away in 2011 I stuck
around and tried to help for a couple of years but ended up moving on and went to
see a few founders around that time Brian Teske being one of them Evan Spiegel
who I also worked with and Travis at Uber who I didn't and and without being
too onerous in making that point I think the answers to the conversations we had
were that they were trying to build humanistic brands so let me talk now a
little bit about Brian Chesky who I have a lot of time for and and speak to
regularly and spent three of three I think three years building from the
bailo which was the logo that looks like a piece of the human anatomy I don't
think I need to tell you which part you can all use your imaginations from the
introduction of that through to a campaign called don't go there live
there which was this notion of actually very similar to Steve in a way it wasn't
about changing people through travel it was changing how people live through
travel the premise of which was you know people don't want to own things they
want experiences these days and so we actually I worked a couple of days a
week for Brian and his team inside of inside of Airbnb building the
experiences all of these different experiences the experiences product
there's sort of incubator for that and it got launched within the trips platform
which is kind of a keynote like explanation and I think as you look at
and all the way up until what Brian did just recently as he had to lay people
off and just the the tenor with which he did that the thoughtfulness of how he
shared that information was testament to everything that the values are that
Apple that excuse me Airbnb lives up to and I think when you spend time with
Airbnb you realize what kind of a phenomenal organization it is that he's
built it's that I think one of the world's largest community-driven super
brands and it really was very important to internally to build hosting culture
and that humanity to understand how important is to host and being welcome
and I would argue that anybody here that uses Airbnb brings their best human I
don't know about you but I'll go on Airbnb like oh that looks like a good
place and you bring your best human you go oh I'm just having to be in town with
my lovely little family would you mind if I stayed your place looks lovely and
you go you stay they leave you a little note you have a little package you feel
the humanity of each other and then at the end mostly when you have experiences
you go on Yelp or TripAdvisor and say some horrible things they're actually
very very thoughtfully and carefully thought about the review process and the
review process the first review you do is a private review and the private
review is like yeah you know what there there's a little bit of whatever's damp
in the downsized toilet and maybe you need to put some more toilet roll or
whatever the silly little things are you do those privately and then you do a
public review your public review says you know what it was awesome I loved it
it was great and I think that separation of those two things was just a very
intentional way to create a human-centric brand that most people I
think have a great relationship with it allows you to see live like a local and
see a city in a different way but it's created through the harmony of human
connection when I jump to another example Emily came to us I work with a
company called founder FNDR my explanation for FNDR is that we
couldn't afford the vowels that's big Chinese company so we lost the vowels and
ended up with FNDR but we're founder we work with founders as you can see Emily
came to us we talked she was up on stage is telling everybody about about
you know brands built through conversation and after a couple of
conversations I was like I don't think you need help and she's like are you kidding me
I actually am about to explode in size and I have these incredible values but I
don't want to go through it and I want to make sure that we build the playbook
for growth so that we intentionally grow and so everything you see and I don't
claim too much credit for Emily because she does a terrific job on her own but
we just sort of helped her with the language that the places in which those
values would come up I think anybody that has either a younger daughter or
is a millennial woman understands that with full beauty within actually then
social women want to spend a lot of time talking and not just buying and it's
just a real understanding of conversational commerce and a people
powered ecosystem you go into a glossier store you see young people they're
looking at each other that they're saying what does this look like do you
like that you're taking pictures of each other and the brand is really about
people first it's a people driven ecosystem and products come second and
you know there's so I can tell lots of stories but the pink pouch for those
people that know you know know it is this wonderful container that you can
throw in your Chanel lipstick and also have your glossier and other products
and people look across the room with each other and say yep you're a glossier
person too I really think she's just at the beginning of building a superpower
of a brand very much brought built on community and connectedness between a
group of people and those but those niches it's kind of multi-niche I always
talk about how the new mass is multi-niche and I think that's the best
way to think about it of course the technology that many people on know
more about than I do Steve used to laugh at my inability to understand technology
but maybe that's why I can explain it to other people multi-niche being the new
place so what glossy is about instead of just a niche it's multiple niches you'll
find your niche there and of course that's the opportunity of technology now
so you got a glossy and you found your niche of people and you have a
conversation so that's glossy a next example is our friend Evan at snap I knew
Evan from a bunch of years ago as I said I went to see him in 2014 I ended up
working with Brian and then ended up working with Evan just with founder
recently in the last few years you know it's obvious I think I don't have to
tell this story to too strongly but the what when social networks became social
media the price of free became then using your data and letting letting
down a little democracy I guess to not put a finer point on it but selling your
data not being clear about what where it's going and and but from a human
point of view I think the big insight there was I walked on the beach with
Evan and I said to him lying to strangers truth to friends which was and
that was three or four years ago before that everything that's come out with
Facebook and sort of all of the things that have been going on but I think from
a human behavior point of view lying to strangers truth to friends lying to
strangers is what you're doing a lot of social platforms you are lying that
you're not happy family just posted a picture of your happy family actually
getting divorced or whatever the thing is whatever behavior people have come to
do on social media that is not real or true and strangers you can't have 15
thousand friends I'm sorry I don't believe you
hi James sorry just we done you've got one more minute left and presentation
but one more minute and we've got a wrap up no problem I'm almost there so so she
you know we work with Evan create a campaign called real friends which is
all about friendship it snaps many things but it is definitely about real
and being honest and true and just friends it's a small group Dunbar's law
it's less than 15 and that's how you get intimate and I just very quickly just
want to say I'm proud of all three of the CEOs that I just talked about
because they've all been incredibly human-centric responses to the crisis
whether it was Airbnb's having to lay people off and writing that very
thoughtful note Evan Spiegel's call for a reparations Commission which was super
smart and Emily's Glossier donating a million dollars kind of the first of all
of them and they all followed suit after that next wave of business this is a
chart that is probably should take longer than I've got but I just think
that we're over the first this moment and I think our opportunity in the next
decade and human-centric brands can help us with that to move from disruption to
adaption to move from distribution to contribution and from distraction to
interaction all of those things are human things on the right and if I have
to I've only got 10 more seconds and leave it with Steve this was the last
chart he showed in public technology alone is not enough
technology married with liberal arts married with the humanities that makes
that yields that makes your heart sing and I would ask each of you on this call
what's your story and how can you be a human-centric brand thank you great
thank you so much James that was a really great way to end that awesome
presentation on how to yeah give a human-centric approach to yeah the crisis
you know in addition to building human-centric brands so yeah next up we
have Leanne Kent founder and CEO of ever ledger a digital transparency company
that was founded in 2015 to help verify the diamond industry she'll be
presenting a keynote on climate change as a man-made problem with a
technological solution just a brief intro about her so Leanne is also the
Queensland chief entrepreneur she's a prominent figure in the technology
sector and co-chairs the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on the
future of manufacturing as well as the Global Future Council on blockchain she
also leads work streams at the global blockchain business council co-chairs
the World Trade Board sustainable trade action group and is on the IBM
blockchain platform board of advisors so yeah she's well placed to to share
about how we can solve this this you know solve climate change with with
technology so yeah I'd like to welcome Leanne thanks everyone great to be
connected look I'm gonna sprint through this marathon of content that I have in
front of me I began with a vision in the heart of London in 2015 to use the very
best of emerging technologies to solve for a pretty incredible set of grand
challenges that still existed across a number of decades and that was to give
the voice of the object and to the diamond industry or in fact any object
of value how do we create a platform of provenance we certainly have
marketplaces in the world but there's no such thing as a platform of provenance
that hooks beneath marketplaces where fundamentally consumers with a full
consciousness of mine can ask the question where does it come from and in
that question we're able to give the full journey of the diamond industry and
that was my vision in 2015 and I wind forward to today and of course the
diamond industry if you walk into a Tiffany store or major retailers around
the world and ask the question where does it come from that answer is hidden
within the transparency layer of blockchain a technology that will
change the way we act and also it started to change the way we think we
are moving from what we once knew was the World Wide Web to the worldwide
ledger but let me share my vision for 2030 by then we're living in a global
circular economy one that has become intentionally transparent this open
mindset has released a surge in trust throughout the world supply chains that
encourages high visibility and greater control over responsible sourcing now we
have ethical and sustainable supply chains in which rewards shared
equability and the right from local communities through to the primary
consumer and well beyond you know we talk and we think about and we all know
for Industrial Revolution technology such as blockchain and artificial
intelligence the Internet of Things nanotechnologies have helped to
facilitate the tracking of critical metals and minerals from right the way
from the mine to the consumer and this transparency has heralded a new normal
in which the raw materials we use for manufacturing and construction can be
traced from the moment that they're extracted of the earth right the way
through to the remanufacturing process and eventually in the deconstruction
and the reuse so in 2030 my vision and the world no one's talking about the
circular economy because it's just the economy the hard yards in increasing
social prosperity whilst reducing dependence on primary materials and
energy have already been done we winced at the grim days of the 2010s when
billions of tons of materials were extracted every year to make functional
needs of society but only a fraction of those important materials were ever
recycled back to into our economy you know the people in 2030 will celebrate
the initiatives that were launched to drive action towards a net zero carbon
emission from heavy industry as well as the heavy-duty transport sector
improvements in sustainability in the battery supply chains enable new
transport and power industries to reduce emissions by more than 30% this is going
to put economies back on track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement now
looking back in 2030 a few categories benefited more from the vision of our
politicians and entrepreneurs than the battery industry that cell powered
revolution that's well underway now will create more than 10 million jobs at
150 billion dollars to the global economy and provide electricity to more
than 600 million people this decade is indeed the decade for action and the
most period for change but is also the decade for battery store industry
electric vehicles and portable devices all need stored energy wrapping falling
technology costs have created a major opportunity to reduce waste and the
Internet of Things started to keep track of valuable products well beyond diamonds
and materials were produced more cheaply than ever before in the past rapidly
increasing opportunities to recover them we begin integrating into the economy
our planet system by preserving and enhancing natural capital like never
before and we're focused on capturing more value from existing infrastructure
and we're designing out the impacts of pollution climate change toxins and
congestion we finally got our act together large value chains finally
start taking a systems approach to how they manage materials and waste
recognizing that one company's output is another company's input and guess what
there's money to be made the move from natural mining to urban mining is well
underway and governments and cities spark the revolution what was the one
thing that made a difference more than anything else some people are going to
port port point to the youth movement that drove awareness and campaign for
action others are going to champion the new breakthroughs in technology that
were unthinkable in 2020 but in my vision these played a part but only a
small part we would never have gotten there if the world's lawmakers and
policymakers stayed on the sidelines from Shanghai to New York to Mumbai to
Australia the authorities entered a new arena rather than waiting for the
development to run its course they got involved and with good reason after all
it was the public sector and policymakers who could strongly influence
industries through infrastructure investments public transport zoning laws
building standards and agricultural subsidies they were able to steer out
comes at a systems level and urban planning mobility and food systems all
managed to integrate new technologies effectively avoiding the risk of
massive structural waste now the private sector wasn't alone to leave the public
sector behind the right rules were put in place to ensure that jobs were
preserved and that new ones were created governments recognized in time
that the maintenance and refurbishment of products can require more human
input so they shifted the fiscal incentives towards renewables to
encourage the use of labor now of course more importantly governments also
recognize the threat of the rebound effect from the circular economy
technology drives prices down which of course is good news in some respects but
as relative prices decrease consumers tend to use more individualized
transport floor space and food in other words the less stuff costs the more we
want to use it to eat it and in fact waste it policymakers act quickly to
avoid the potential environmental ricochet that causes the increased
prosperity now nation states integrate new technologies and business models
into their economy in a way that maximizes the value extracted from assets
and material stocks instead of rusting away into a ghost town cities become
green and self-sustaining habitats for its citizens new business models address
much of the structural waste in mobility in food and in buildings and create an
entirely new consumer choice by increasing utilization and longevity
communities harness a significant economic upside that successfully avoids
any negative system effect and regulators stop treating waste simply as
an environmental safety hazard rather they're using it as a source of valuable
materials and products the administrative and legal barriers to
redesigning products reusing repurposing recovering and trading were completely
erased City Hall took the lead on integrating hidden costs such as carbon
and congestion into the whole of life value of infrastructure and services
and components are upcycled and remanufactured because much of it is
easier and cheaper and less shameful than ever before no longer are we
throwing things away so I'm looking forward to 2030 my vision came through in
2015 about the traceability of some of the most opaque supply chains in the
world and in my vision we'll share an economy that is restorative and
regenerative that preserves ecosystems and increases their return over time now
this is going to create prosperity prosperity that fuels growth by
capturing more value from existing infrastructure and products ever before
sounds good doesn't it well guess what sorry I was on mute the whole time
thank you Leanne for that really insightful pep talk on yeah just how we
can solve these issues today with climate change and bring more prosperity
to the world for those of you who want to ask Leanne any questions I think that
there's a Q&A button that you can click on or a room that you can go to to kind
of yeah ask her any more questions that you have and up next we have Leah Schmidt
so Leah is the product partnerships she's leading product and partnerships at
centrifuge centrifuge a protocol for decentralized asset finance she'll be
talking about the great rationing from iPhone queues to food shortages and how
we can fix supply chains so Leah welcome to the virtual stage thanks so much for
introduction so as Samantha already said I'm gonna be talking about the great
rationing and where supply chains are currently failing and how web3 is here
to help my name is Leah I have been with centrifuge about two years now where I
lead product partnerships and basically what I do is I help asset originators
and finance their assets by our protocol and by a defy the decentralized
financial ecosystem there's an Q&A afterwards but if you see this video
later feel free to reach out to me anytime by email so I'm gonna take a
look at supply chains and I believe on an average day the average person
probably spends their time thinking about supply chain efficiencies the only
other hiccups that we've experienced is probably cyber Monday or when the new
iPhone comes out but besides that not so much and just recently we have been
confronted with a really different picture so I think everyone is familiar
with empty shelves in supermarkets no toilet paper to be found and suddenly
huge queues in front of supermarkets not just in a physical store but also
online and besides toilet paper that we were lacking there was also huge hiccups
in supply chain for medical supplies such as face masks and ventilators and
I'm gonna take a look at some of these reasons and that cost me so if you take
a look at supply chains they are extremely complex global chains that
that connects millions of businesses of all sizes around the globe so this is an
extremely simplified overview of how a supply chain can look like so here you
have a shoe manufacturer shoe manufacturing laces laces needs fabric
late and fabric needs cotton so and if you follow down that path a simple
supply chain can go down to 40 tiers really fast really easily and with zero
to a very limited visibility to the top tiers what actually is going down in the
lower tiers of the supply chain and the one link fails it can have really
drastic impacts and during the pandemic there definitely have been businesses
that have profited from from that situation I've just mentioned online
supermarkets but also streaming services etc but I'm really gonna focus on those
many businesses that have suffered throughout this this when the pandemic
started and where covert 19 really has been representing a black swan for their
supply chain and manufacturing so I've said if one link in the supply chain
fails it can have severe impacts what if really key suppliers are down so in
Wuhan where the pandemic started this entire city has been in complete
lockdown shutdown for several months and Wuhan is also often considered as the
world's factory so more than 200 of the fortune 500 companies have their
presence there and imagine now these key suppliers are down to combat the spread
of the virus a lot of shops have been closing down unfortunately a lot of
people were had had been laid off which resulted in sporadic sales in stores on
the other hand we had these rational but also irrational demand surges so on the
one hand I said there was an increased demand for medical supplies but then
also people were just stocking up on toilet paper and flour yeast etc and an
average supply chain is really designed for the average demand because it's so
costly to design for the peak demands and to be able for those businesses to
be able to cope with this situation to on the one hand ramp up ramp up
production but or also stabilize the inventory and financial support is more
crucial than ever and at centrifuge we love to show the slide because we always
highlight the the size of the issue of optimizing your cash flow so for a B2B
for B2B and Nirvana is really to get paid on time it's just like when the
money hits my bank account and on an average the average time that a company
has to wait until they actually get paid is usually 60 days so 60 days which can
extend to easily four to five months and this is the waiting period
until you get paid but really in the meantime you have to pay your staff you
have to pay for production etc there are companies already out there or they
actually 30 years in the making there have been solutions that try to cater
this need and that is already there corona unrelated there are supply chain
finance there is factoring but these solutions really only cover 2% of the
actual need and if you look at this huge bubble is 180 trillion which is the
global B2B spend these are the these are the invoices that float around between
businesses and payments that that need to be optimized and with on a normal
day only 2% being covered by outstanding by existing solutions now take the
corona pandemic and the issue is is increased tremendously these such a
these solutions that I mentioned are also most of the time they only extend
to businesses to like tier one sometimes tier two they are very exclusive
exclusive and for smaller businesses they actually can get really expensive
or are not accessible in the first place and what happens now during covert is
what we've seen that there is even less flexibility so a lot of manufacturers
shift from open books to advance payments so often time if if you have
long-lasting relationships and you usually have maybe 50% upfront get paid
by by your buyer and then the rest of the 50% you get paid until the when the
cargo leaves the warehouse now to be able to mitigate risk more and more
manufacturers are actually asking for more advanced payments with its
existing solutions even if you have a perfect balance sheets you sometimes just
really don't put the criteria and now more than ever the trust in companies
has deteriorated and banks are withdrawing the lines of credit just
like I think four weeks ago Deutsche Bank downgraded GM because they have
around 15 weeks of cash until they have problems operate and GM is a fortune
partner company and now just think of the small to medium businesses that also
are in need for financing and there are solutions out there or there are
solutions being created but this is really the relationships that you already
have become more essential than ever so cash there is really a need for a
flexible cash that is accessible to anyone and this is exactly where web 3
is is coming in and where the structure fits so perfectly so what I mentioned
earlier DeFi decentralized financial ecosystem is built on on open
decentralized infrastructure with no built-in gatekeepers so it's really
accessible to for everyone and we've also seen in during this during this
Corona pandemic an industry that is so heavily reliant on the physical presence
and the and physical goods such as paper where people really need to show up on
ports to to verify the ownership of the cargo this is really a flawed system
this is a system that has not been innovated for more than 400 years so
with blockchain technology it is possible to uniquely identify the status
of a document and help prevent like help this use case for example bankless
lending so there is really a need for alternative sources of liquidity or
source liquidity that solutions that operate out of the out of the norm of
current financial institutions so with solutions in DeFi instead of having to
go through the entire trouble with a bank you can actually instead of a bank
lending money to extending money to you a smart contract can do that more
liquidity what the beauty of blockchain is really that you can automate
processes and you can make financial tools from the traditional financial
sector available to more people one example here that I will go and a little
bit more into detail a securitization for example if structured properly this
is really a great tool for freeing up liquidity and optimizing risk allocation
and it's oftentimes only reserved for bigger companies because it's so
cumbersome and costly and all these things that I've mentioned now this is
really what centrifuge has been working towards and what our application
centrifuge tin leg is is built for what we do is we help so-called acid
originators bring their asset that they have such as invoices warehouse receipts
purchase orders on chain tokenize these sort of fingerprint these documents and
have them represented as so-called NFTs or non fungible tokens and this is
really the gateway for companies to access DeFi and as the DeFi ecosystem
mostly for now works with fungible assets and we built this we built tin leg
which is our securitization protocol where these unique assets that you now
have on chain where you pull these assets bundle them and mint fungible
erc20 tokens on top of it that they can now be plugged into decentralized
liquidity providers such as lending protocols such as maker for example this
is our tech stack so we have our peer-to-peer messaging protocol this is
where businesses exchange their documents in a private and secure way we
on top of that we've built our centrifuge chain which holds the single
source of truth for all parties so and we work with anchors that allows these
businesses to tokenize their documents and have them represented in NFTs on
top of that we built in leg which I just mentioned and it can other
applications can be built on top and plugged into DeFi and this is a little
bit more into detail how our securitization protocol works so you
have you have invoices for example they are bundled together in in a tin leg
pool based on that you have two types of erc20 tokens are minted so we have the
drop token which is our senior tranche and you have the tin token which is our
junior tranche and the two of them are interest-bearing tokens but they work a
little bit differently so the drop token is a token that gives investors a stable
return and it's also risk or it's loss protected first was protected by the tin
token so the tin token has the potential of higher yield but it also takes the
first loss and whenever so investors can pay into a tin leg pool depending on
their risk appetite and the borrower on the other side gets paid out in in
cryptocurrency such a style and whenever an invoice for example is paid back and
first the drop investors are paid back and then the tin investors and this
really is is a great tool to help businesses unlock liquidity in a in a
risk-optimized way we are not just building this in in theory but we've
actually been financing several pools so far we are working with several asset
originators one of them is console freight which is a technos the
technology provider for freight forwarders and they help freight
forwarders unlock or advance payments to the stakeholders that are involved in
global trade and on the other hand we have the liquidity provider we have
maker which is a decentralized stable coin and the way it works currently is
that you lock crypto assets and ask collateral in in this protocol and in
return receive die we are currently working with console freight we're
currently in the and the governance process of locking freight invoices into
maker to extend basically to have an a decentralized line of credit for console
freight our first tin like pool is is live you can visit us on tin lake dot
centrifuge dot IO and and take a look in June there are more to come we
currently have console freight and series one life the series two is coming
and we're also be going to be live with paper chain another asset originator
that felis it facilitates payments for streaming invoices and more to come and
we really think that the financial in this infrastructure is ripe for
innovation and that we just need to dismantle it and like strip it down to
the to the basics and reassemble it for making the supply chain just more
resilient for more for for the next shakeups that are going to come if you
have any questions feel free to reach out and that's it for me for now thank
you
thank you yeah for that yeah really comprehensive presentation about you
know the need to I guess reassemble like she ended on that note the financial
infrastructure to make supply chains more resilient for what's to come in the
next few years considering what we're going through at the moment at this
current global crisis and global pandemic so we've got a break now and
we'll be back at 12 p.m. but from now onwards at I guess from 11 a.m. UK time
there'll be Q&A's so actually ignore that so James's Q&A will actually help
happen later in the day at about maybe 4 p.m. UK time it's just late for him right
now in in California so I think he's got to catch some sleep but yeah I think
there'll be like it either an extra booth or a a Q&A and you know for those
who are interested and who were you know interested in his his talk you can you
know kind of tune in at 4 p.m. to to ask him a couple of questions and then at
11 15 Leanne will come back on and if there's any questions you can kind of
send them through and and and she'll be able to answer it then and then there's
Leah coming back on at 11 45 so that will happen in the next hour and for
those of you who you know are sharing about the discussions on socials or
tuning in to the conversations don't forget to hashtag COG X 2020 and yeah I
guess enjoy your break go have a stretch grab a cup of tea or coffee and we'll be
back at 12 p.m. with Trent McConaughey co-founder of ocean protocols so thanks
for tuning in hope you're enjoying the discussion so far and have a good break

Welcome back, everybody.
You're joining the Web 3.0 stage of
COGX 2020.
This stage is run by Fabric Ventures vc,
and we hope
for those who've just joined us,
for those who've just joined us this morning
that you're enjoying yourself and you had
a good break, and you've got, you know, a cup of coffee
the next hour where we've got a presentation by Trent McConnachie, co-founder of Ocean
Protocol, speaking on the coronavirus trilemma, when democracy meets pandemics.
And right after his presentation, there'll be a panel discussion led by Jemima Kelly
from the FT.
So as we just lead into Trent's discussion, well, presentation, I'd just like to give
you a brief overview of Trent and Ocean Protocol.
So Ocean Protocol is aiming to democratize data for use in privacy and AI.
And Trent did AI research for two decades, including machine creativity and AI to help
drive Moore's Law.
So I hope you'll enjoy the presentation.
And yeah, over to you, Trent.
Thank you very much for having me here at COGX.
And hello, everyone out there in the virtual world or the real world connected virtually,
whatever it is.
And yeah, let's get started.
So I'm going to start the title of my talk, which points to this trade-off we have among
three objectives, the objectives of safety, privacy, and the economy.
Pick any two.
And so that's the question.
Do we have to pick just two, or can we get away with everything?
So if we rewind to December of last year, we had things like this market in Wuhan, China.
At the time, it was pretty standard.
Back then in China, even going back many, many years, people wear masks.
And this is simply a market there.
But this is how things were in Wuhan in December of last year.
And within the span of about four weeks, it changed to this.
Well, this isn't Wuhan, of course.
This is elsewhere, but four weeks later, eight weeks later, et cetera, coronavirus spread
throughout the world.
And we had basically places deserted everywhere because of social distancing to help slow
the spread of this pandemic.
So we went from the status quo as we knew it to sort of a potentially new status quo,
or at least our brains think the status quo right now.
So that's where we're at.
We've got this pandemic happening.
And China itself was the first to move to take action because, well, of course, this
thing grew exponentially.
And they moved to take action with a lot of surveillance in various forms to basically
track where any potential carrier might be of the coronavirus, to test aggressively,
and with social distancing, and many other things basically to try to stop this coronavirus
in its tracks.
And it was, by and large, quite successful.
The number of new cases dropped dramatically in China.
And there's lots of numbers to back this up.
But the question is, at what cost?
So overall, you can summarize the challenges that China and other places face.
In China, there was this move to bring back the safety, which was basically social distancing
and all of this, such that the coronavirus stopped basically killing people.
And at the same time, though, if you have full lockdown, like Wuhan had and elsewhere,
then it is devastating to the economy.
So China's approach was to have massive surveillance, like I mentioned, and then once safety got
in place, then to do things to start kickstarting the economy, in its case with turning manufacturing
back on and so on and so forth.
So this is kind of how China approached coronavirus in broad brushstrokes.
And with the social contract that China roughly has with its citizens, this is even potentially
OK in China.
But a lot of the West, of course, has different views of privacy.
To quote Benjamin Franklin, those who would give up essential safety to purchase a little
temporary liberty deserve neither liberty nor safety.
This is a very Western view.
And of course, many Western ideals derived from Ben Franklin, the man, and obviously
many other people that are sort of philosopher-thinkers that helped to construct democracies hundreds
of years ago, the first democracies.
So this is basically what China ended up with.
But the question is, what about the rest of the world?
The UK decided, you know what, let's basically try to keep our economy going.
And they didn't have to worry about privacy and how to do it.
Go for this concept of herd immunity.
And there was a lot of discussion about this, where basically they were looking at not doing
massive lockdowns.
But fortunately, there was very big pushback in the press internationally, as well as by
the people themselves.
And in the end, the lockdowns still happened.
So there wasn't this massive push to herd immunity.
Of course, if that happened, then the hospitals would have been overwhelmed.
And there would have been really big problems.
And of course, we've seen in many nations, the hospitals did get overwhelmed, including
Wuhan in the early days, including in Italy and other places.
So fortunately, UK didn't move towards this.
Sweden moved a bit towards this, unlike its Nordic neighbors, where they didn't lock down
nearly as heavily.
And if you look at their relative death tolls, et cetera, compared to their neighbors, it's
been quite a lot worse.
So this was basically, if you think about it, there was choosing to keep the economy
going, hurting the safety of the citizens.
And because there wasn't a push towards the safety in a big way, then privacy laws, et
cetera, didn't really change.
So this is sort of taking a different two of these three.
A third way, which we're seeing in Germany, where I'm based, and many other Western nations
is definitely go for safety.
So try to keep the number of infections, et cetera, sufficiently low, such that the hospitals
don't get overwhelmed.
Because if they get overwhelmed, then the death rate spikes.
And Germany, as most of the audience I'm sure knows, Germany is very strong with respect
to its privacy laws and rules.
It had laws before GDPR.
The German laws influenced GDPR, these general data protection regulations that have been
rolled out across Europe.
But of course, in going for safety, in doing things like lockdowns in particular, then
businesses could not run as normal.
So it's really been hard on the economy.
A lot of jobs have been lost, et cetera, et cetera.
This isn't just Germany either.
It's a lot of Western nations.
The USA has had tens of millions of jobs lost due to this lockdown and stuff, for example.
So it looks like we're at this sort of dilemma.
We have these three things that we want to aim for, safety, economy, and privacy.
But it looks like we're only going to get two.
And you might ask also, it's really worth going back to Ben Franklin on the privacy.
Why is privacy so important?
And the answer is, privacy is critical to democracy.
For democracies to stay legitimate, government's power must be kept in check by citizens.
Citizens need the ability to gather in private, to organize protests, to speak out.
They shouldn't need to worry about the government tracking every movement, monitoring who they
meet, and curtailing free speech.
So overall, state surveillance, you can view it as a moral hazard, gone unchecked.
It can lead to sort of big brother authoritarian regimes.
So that's why privacy is so, so, so critical.
And that's why Germany, of course, wants to maintain it, and many Western nations.
It's really strongly tied to democracy itself.
So here's the goal, to have all three.
Can we have our cake and eat it too, if you will?
And overall, I'm an engineer, and in engineering, we're often confronted with tradeoffs of two
or three or more things.
So a triangle is simply a way of visualizing a tradeoff among three things.
In this case, safety, economy, and privacy.
Some have called it the coronavirus trilemma.
I've also published a piece, even before those days, calling it the pandemic triangle.
Whatever the label, basically, there's a tradeoff among these three things.
Now, here's the cool news.
When you have tradeoffs in engineering, if you're sneaky about it, sometimes you can
break the tradeoff.
Sometimes it isn't some sort of fundamental tradeoff.
So for example, in the world of decentralization, there is a frameless triangle called Zuko's
triangle, where it's a network where names are ideally human-meaningful, secure, and
decentralized.
And traditionally, you can only pick any two.
But then famously, Aaron Swartz squared this triangle using blockchain technology.
And there's other triangles as well.
For example, in project management, there's this thing called the scope triangle, where
there's a tradeoff in cost, time, and quality.
Pick any two.
So here, we've got a tradeoff in safety, economy, and privacy slash democracy, pick any two.
Or is there a tradeoff, right?
Can we be sneaky about it?
Can we pull an Aaron Swartz and try to square this triangle?
That's the question.
So if we think about it, first of all, maybe there's some tactics that we can use epistemically
to approach this that are just pragmatic things that don't compromise on anything.
And so I'm just going to run through a list of some of these.
I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on any of this.
It's more about the idea of trying things that have bounded downside negatives, but
potentially big upside positives.
So sort of Nicholas Nassim Taleb type thinking.
So here's a few, right?
First of all, don't do stupid stuff.
And I'll give a list of this.
And you might think, of course, that's obvious.
But we've seen actually actions from governments that still isn't the brightest.
And then, yeah, like I mentioned, do things that have bounded downside and potentially
big upside and stack them together and see what we can get coming out of that.
So for example, here's some stupid stuff to avoid.
Don't hold a protest against coronavirus, right?
You got 1,000, 10,000 people shoulder to shoulder, potentially not wearing masks, claiming it's
needed for liberty or something.
This is probably not the wisest move.
Also, probably not very smart to call it a hoax because that's misleading your citizens
in the wrong direction.
And then you end up with more people dead than from previous like Vietnam War and stuff
like that.
Also, probably not a good idea to suppress testing just so that it looks good to keep
your case numbers low.
Exponentials like this don't care, right?
The pandemic virus, it's not listening to the news.
It's not hearing what leaders are saying.
It's just replicating, replicating.
So these case numbers are going to blow up anyway.
And you can just simply look at the death count, et cetera.
Probably also not a good idea to withdraw funding from health agencies and also not
a good idea to encourage your citizens to go out.
I pointed all of these because if we rewind eight weeks, we would have all said, yeah,
this looks very silly.
Why would anyone do this?
But we have seen governments doing this because incentives haven't been quite aligned with
the safety of their citizens, unfortunately.
There's some other low hanging fruit along the lines of doing things with bounded downsides
and potentially big upside.
It's no risk at all basically to wear a mask or if there is that somehow I haven't heard
about it, it's super minimal.
But by doing that, you're greatly reducing the chance of getting infected from someone
else as well as greatly reducing the chance of infecting someone else.
So for example, pretty early on in mid-March, the Czech Republic was one of the very first
countries to mandate the use of masks.
And the citizens of the Czech Republic got sewing and they managed to really keep a lot
of the spread at bay and that helped a lot.
So this is just something once again, a minimal downside, potentially big upside.
And this was at the time flying in the face from recommendations of the WHO and others,
which were basically trying to keep the masks for safety of the health workers.
But overall, once again, exponentials, they don't care.
And if you can prevent the spread, then you end up avoiding these exponentials proceeding.
So masks is a good idea.
Another one which we've seen a lot of talk about is privacy preserving technology.
So contact tracing, we've seen proposals from the big mobile OS vendors like Apple and Google
working together.
That's one of the things, right, where it has, and it can do it in a way that's trying
to preserve privacy.
So you can basically see, you know, if you get coronavirus, well, who were you in contact
with in the last two weeks?
And then there can be some privacy preserving technology to help ensure that that data is
shared in a way that's actionable, yet at the same time, minimizing the leakage of personally
identifiably identifiable information that can be used against you.
And it's not just contact tracing, it kind of goes across the board.
For example, you know, hospitals themselves are trying to figure out how to and researchers
are trying to do vaccines.
And usually when a lot of this is very data driven, where you're building AI models.
So if you can have an AI model that can do predictions of how useful a therapy is, or
even what's the chance of someone having coronavirus, then the more data you have, the better.
But of course, the more data you have, then if this data is all, you know, visible to
researchers, etc., then it opens up attack vectors for people to potentially misuse that
personally identifiable information.
The cool thing is there's a lot of technology out there that's emerging, where you can merge
together, where you can merge together, where you can merge together the data in ways where
you can build AI models and where you can build the AI models without compromising the
privacy.
So, and, you know, as sort of a quick laundry list, there's things like federated learning,
homomorphic encryption, bringing compute to the data, simple encryption and decryption,
multiparty compute, etc., etc.
And this is where I spend my days.
So I'm quite familiar with it, of course.
Another one, of course, is aggressive testing.
So like drive-through testing, this is an example from Germany.
And you know, maybe a good one simply is be Taiwan, right?
Taiwan is an example of a country that was exposed very early to potentially a lot of
cases.
And they were very aggressive in rolling out tactics.
By one count, 124 different tactics that basically did all of the above.
They had masks, they had really good contact tracing, they had really good testing, etc.,
etc. through the whole sort of life cycle of the coronavirus.
And even how they approached it, they managed to keep the privacy concerns quite low because
of how they approach things.
So being Taiwan is a pretty good starting point.
And so to conclude, basically with will, I believe that all three are possible.
We can have safety, economy and privacy.
We don't have to compromise.
We don't have to necessarily trash the economy as time goes on or trash safety or trash privacy.
We can have all three.
And of course, we're farther along now than when I initially wrote this article.
But as we it still matters, because as we look to reboot our economies, we can do it
in a way where we don't compromise privacy or safety.
So I will stop there.
And thank you, everyone, for for watching.
I'm really sorry, I think I was on mute the whole time.
That's really embarrassing.
Thank you very much, Trent, for that presentation.
It was a great note to end on.
So yeah, I guess for those who have questions for Trent, do pop them on the box on the side
of the screen.
I'm sure you'll see that there's a Q&A poll.
There will be a Q&A session starting at 1pm UK time.
So we just pop them there, I'm sure Trent will be able to answer them.
And now, you know, on to the next panel discussion, I'd like to hand over the virtual stage to
the moderator for this session, which is Jemima Kelly, the journalist at the FT, who writes
for FT Alphaville.
At the moment, her work is focused mainly on coronavirus.
But she also often writes about blockchain, fintech and technology more broadly.
I always look forward to your blog posts.
So yeah, over to you, Jemima.
Cool.
Thank you.
Well, hello, everyone.
And welcome to this panel.
That was a really nice introduction, I think, from Trent, because he's basically given
us a presentation about what we're going to be discussing, which is when democracy meets
pandemics and this trilemma that he's that he's talked about between those three things.
So can I introduce everyone?
So we've got Trent back.
Hi, Trent.
And then we have Santiago Siri and Pooja Olhava.
Is that how I pronounce your surname?
Olhava.
Hi.
So I think we've kind of we've got we've had we've had an introduction to Trent.
But do the other two of you want to just briefly introduce yourselves and maybe just give us
like a few words about how your work might be kind of overlapping into, you know, how
you're kind of working on coronavirus as well?
Or not just the actual virus, let me rephrase that, how your work is kind of into this kind
of the crisis that we now face with several crises.
Do you want to start, Pooja?
Well, I can jump on that.
No, sure.
Go for it, Santiago.
You can start.
Do you want to just introduce yourself and tell us how your work relates to this?
Yes, I'm Santiago Siri.
We're a non-profit organization that is trying to understand democracy in the information
age.
Boils down to understanding what key technologies are required in order to deploy democracies
anywhere there's an Internet connection.
Democracies that are free, that are open source and that are censorship resistant.
So we do a lot of research in the blockchain space.
And of course, during COVID, you know, it has been really interesting to watch how it
has impacted the adoption of new technology.
In particular, you know, I work very closely with another project called Open Collective.
And I have seen over the last two or three months, a lot of collectives, which are like
are beautiful organizations that have been created to help those in need and to coordinate
efforts to assist, you know, doctors and those that are on the trenches fighting the virus.
And in regards to blockchain technology, you know, it's I think it remains to be seen more
adoption of the tech itself in terms of usability.
But there's also interesting distributed autonomous organizations and stuff like that.
That's what we work on on democracy.
Okay, cool.
What about you, Pooja?
Hi.
So I'm a CEO of Rear Pass Surgical and relevant to this discussion, I'm also a collaborator
with the Edmund J. Sauer Center for Ethics at Harvard in their roadmap to pandemic resilience.
And this is an initiative that's led by Daniel Allen, which has also now joined forces with
the Harvard School of Public Health led by Ashish Jha.
I'm a co-author to the recent report, Getting It Done, which outlines a testing, tracing
and supported isolation strategy, we call it TTSI, to suppress prevalence down to close
to zero.
And the goal of this software suppression plan is to restore a free society with a pandemic
resilient economy, where people feel safe to go to work, schools and churches without
curing outbreaks, and ultimately to sidestep the trial that you've been discussing.
Cool.
All right.
Thank you very much.
So maybe I could start by asking the two of you, Pooja and Santiago, whether you have
any kind of immediate responses to what Trent has just outlined?
Sure.
I'll go first.
So the trilemma of safety, economy and privacy, it's in US terms, since I'm an American, we've
framed that as the debate between lives, liberties and livelihoods.
And my view is that this trade-off really is the false choice, and framing it in terms
of trade-offs doesn't really consider the alternatives beyond lockdown, or no lockdowns
and rampant disease spread.
There's a third alternative, which Trent alluded to by referencing Taiwan, and that alternative
is testing, tracing and supported isolation.
Taiwan never went through a lockdown, their economy grew 1.59% in the first quarter, whereas
the UK's economy declined by 1.6%.
What Taiwan and what other countries like South Korea have done, and now what other
countries like New Zealand, Australia and Germany and hopefully the United States will
be doing is TTSI.
And what TTSI means is testing, first of all, testing all symptomatics, not just for therapeutic
purposes, but also diagnostic purposes.
It also means tracing, and tracing not just all the contacts of a positive, but also all
those positive contacts, contacts down a chain of transmission until there are zero positives.
And then there's the isolation prong, and countries have had different approaches to
this, but for the Safra Plan, and for me, isolation means voluntary isolation and paying
the SIG voluntarily to isolate at hotels if needed with health support.
So this is the general view of the TTSI strategy, and we think that if we implement this, not
just in the United States, but in the UK, we can restore our free societies with a pandemic
resilient economy where people feel safe, and we can ultimately drive the virus prevalence
to zero through suppression tactics.
All right.
Brilliant.
Thank you.
I think that's interesting because you've framed it in a slightly different way, and
the use of lives, livelihood, what was the third one?
Lives, livelihood and liberty, that's the one I wanted to talk about, because it seems
to me that the trilemma slightly leaves out that fourth prong, and because you can have
privacy without necessarily having your civil liberties, which is what we've had massively
restricted in the UK and the US, and a lot of people don't think that's okay, given
that the unknowns of the virus is still so extreme, and yes, as Trent said, Sweden has
had higher death numbers, but it hasn't been the kind of apocalypse that many people feared,
and ultimately, it might have had higher death numbers now, but in the long run, will the
negative effects of lockdown outweigh the positives, and will, therefore, somewhere
like Sweden actually end up better off?
Obviously, it's extremely hard to compare because we have completely different demographics
in all these countries, not to say different ways of counting things, and obviously, it's
not like they're operating in a bubble, they're being affected by what we're all doing elsewhere
as well.
It's not like they're just carrying on their normal lives, but I wondered whether Trent
or Santiago, what you think about this, where that fits in the liberty part of it, because
it seems to me that that isn't really considered in this trilemma.
Maybe that's one for you, Trent.
Where does that fit in?
Because it seems like that's a big issue that I think a lot of Westerners have in terms
of trying to emulate what countries in Asia have done.
I think the West feels, particularly the right and the centre-right in the UK and the US
would feel that our civil liberties are one of the most important things that we have
and that we have, and that that makes us stand out from other countries in Asia, for example.
Where does that fit in, Trent?
Yeah, actually, well, I see it, that it bundles into the privacy part, and this is why when
I talk about privacy, I talk about how privacy is essential to a democracy, and a democracy
has freedom, and so to me, it's not even a question of whether you should be trading
out freedom or not.
You have to maintain your freedom, right?
It's sort of a given that way, but there can be trade-offs on the privacy side, but there
should not be trade-offs, or you should really minimise the trade-offs on the freedom side,
because that's simply a given.
I don't think it's a given, though, is it?
Because we're living in the most restrict, you know, our civil liberties have been taken
away from us to a kind of unprecedented extent at the moment, so it's not, I don't know
if it's a given, and I don't know if it can be grouped in with privacy, because being
locked indoors isn't necessarily restricting our privacy, is it?
Well, okay, but fair point, and so I guess, you know, in my conception of it, they're
locked in, but you can unlock it, or like you can, sorry, in my conception, they're
bound together, but if you like, yes, you can unbundle them, and yeah, maybe in my conception,
I just bundled it too tightly, but it's definitely worth discussing on its own.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
Santiago, did you have anything to add on that?
No, I, you know, I was able to, I am Argentine, this whole situation followed me in February
in a vacation in Argentina, so I stayed in my country, doing quarantine there for two
months, and I got back to Spain, where I lived a month ago, so I've been following the conversation
patterns in Argentina and in Spain, and around the world in the U.S., and through social
media, pretty much anywhere, and the weirdest element of this whole thing is how ideological
it's getting, where you see a clear pattern on right-wing populist governments taking
certain type of measures, or lack of measures, whereas probably other governments being much
more restricted on the civil liberties, there's even a term that became popular in Argentina
to describe, you know, Argentina started a very strong early quarantine, and they're
calling it now an infectorship, a mix of, you know, infection and dictatorship, and
it's, to me, it's surreal to see something that should be addressed under scientific
means, you know, it's a massive situation going on in the world, how ideologically
it can get very fast, and how, you know, even in Spain, I have seen civil disobedience
acts, massive rallies called by the far right to disobey the quarantine, you know, the
march of freedom, they call it that way, while we're having a socialist government here that
is, you know, Spain was what, Madrid especially, was one of the most affected cities in the
world from this virus, so even though the situation is very hard at the personal level
for a lot of people here, it still gets people divided, and you see governments where, in
Argentina, actually, the opposition is willing to collaborate with the official government,
whereas in Spain, the opposition is completely, you know, attacking the government for every
single measure they take, and this split in politics is also, you know, hijacking some
of the efforts that are being made to address the virus, and it's incredible that, you
know, in the age of technology and science, you know, politics permeates even the most
urgent and pressing situations.
Is it?
Is that incredible?
I mean, like, the science is so unclear on this, like, none of the scientists agree.
They're all arguing over it.
Some people think that there's an immunity to that matter, and basically, you know, you
know, 80% of people are not going to get it, and other people think that, you know, the
case fatality rate, infection fatality rate, sorry, is above one, and people think it's
like 0.2, which is percent this is, so that makes a massive difference in terms of the
number of deaths.
People disagree on the reproduction number.
They disagree on whether the virus has somehow mutated into something more benign.
I mean, they continue, so I think it's difficult to say that, like, politics are permitting
it.
The thing is, they are in charge, and, you know, like, people are...
It's funny how, in some ways, people are getting upset by the way in which the governments
are dealing with this.
It's like they can't do something that affects me, even though, you know, we live in a system
that kind of gives these people power, so we have given them power, and I guess it's
inevitable that politics are going to come into this when the science is all still kind
of up in the air.
And I don't know whether...
I mean, you talked about technology.
I mean, are these issues that we're talking about really issues that can be resolved by
technology, or are they more kind of structural issues, even if you look at the kind of issues
that you have with, like, contact tracing?
Is that really a technological thing that needs to be solved?
I mean, sure, we need some technology, but there seems to me that there's some kind of
structure, even things like, you know, in the UK, for example, I know that, for example,
there's swabbing, when you're testing yourself, you put the swab in your throat, or, you know,
through your nose and into your throat, and apparently that doesn't pick up as much viral
matter as if you were to be tested in your lungs, so your lungs contain more of the viral
matter, for example.
So it could give you a false negative, for example.
And then there's the fact of the timing and people not sending the test back in time,
blah, blah, blah.
There's all these kind of structural issues, and I'm not sure what the role is.
I mean, how much of a role does technology have here?
I mean, this is a tech conference, so we should...
Well, I have a couple things to say.
So first of all, I think it's very dangerous to be fatalistic saying just because there's
uncertainty in the science, therefore we should ignore the science or, you know, ignore whatever
science has given us for guidance, right?
So that's the first part.
And we're actually seeing that.
And the second thing related is it's pretty clear that many government actions have not
been helpful to the safety of the people, right?
There's actions that could have been done in the early days that help the safety of
the people, help keep the economy on track, don't affect privacy, and these actions weren't
taken.
And instead, governments cast blame, cast blame, cast blame.
Fortunately, that's only some governments.
And even now, those same governments aren't taking blame or taking responsibility, right?
So this goes back to what I mentioned in my initial talk, don't do stupid stuff.
And we keep seeing governments doing stupid stuff.
This is completely independent of science or technology, et cetera.
And so in terms of then, I think we all have responsibilities as citizens to do what we
can ourselves.
We should be taking responsibility for our own lives and then that of our family and
stuff around us.
But then we can also ask what can we do for the people around us, like more and more broadly
in the community and so on, and at the highest government levels as well.
And also see that over time, technology can help to address this, right?
Technology is always a double-edged sword, but here it's pretty clear, as Pooja pointed
out, I'm sure she has details, too, on how we can resolve this three-way trade-off by
leveraging technology in the right ways.
So let's not be fatalistic just because it looks like a trade-off and this is what the
news is telling us.
There isn't necessarily a trade-off if we're not stupid about it.
Right.
I think just to respond to that, I wasn't trying to be fatalistic or to say that we
should ignore the science.
That would be ridiculous.
I was saying that it's quite, I think Santiago was saying that politics is coming in when
it should only be about science and technology.
When I was saying, well, that's a bit difficult because the politicians are the people who
have to make the decisions.
They are the people who we've bestowed with that power.
They are being given conflicting advice from scientists and they ultimately, on their having
to make those decisions, I mean, the chief scientific advisors and the chief medical
officers can tell them what they think and that's presumably, you know, they're an example
of that.
Yes, but we shouldn't, just because they get different advice from their different advisors,
we should not give them a get-out-of-jail-free card for them taking responsibility, right?
Absolutely not.
It's pretty clear that they are getting lots wrong and it's clear that, you know, they're
flailing around miserably, but I'm just wondering whether, because I know you wrote this piece
on the trilemma, for example, back in March, I think, and I get it, like, maybe they didn't
need to be, like, and I like this whole don't do stupid stuff idea, like, that's a good
idea for just life in general that people should adopt a lot more, but I think it's
a bit late now to say, like, clearly we're going to need inquiries into, like, government
failings and clearly there have been lots of government failings, some of those have
been the government's fault, some of those have been the fact that the scientists didn't
quite, perhaps weren't, I'm talking about the UK specifically, perhaps the scientists
weren't, didn't think big enough, didn't think, for example, in the UK that they, in
the UK, if you look at the stage minutes, it's clear that the scientists at that stage
didn't think that a lockdown was feasible. It's easy for us to say now with hindsight,
like, why didn't we lockdown? Like, you know, China was locked down, Italy started lockdown.
When Italy locked down, we were all extremely shocked by it, like, it was the most insane
thing, and we've kind of accepted it as a given now, of course we'll lockdown if we've
got a pandemic, but it was, like, quite a kind of radical idea for these kind of, for
a kind of Western democracy to adopt such a policy. So I think the scientists, well,
back at the start, were kind of a little bit hesitant about recommending that. But there's
all sorts of kind of people who we can blame, but right now, it seems that the kind of,
that might, it might have been false trade-offs, but now we kind of, we have the situation
that we have where we do have thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of cases
and millions of cases, well, globally, and so I guess it's a kind of, you know, we now
have to face that. But just to go into the technology, you said, Pooja, maybe Trent said
that maybe you could talk a bit about this. So what can the technology do here? And because
you talked as well, Trent, about this privacy-preserving tech, without kind of giving us some specifics.
Can we get some specifics on the technology that would be really useful here? Yeah.
Sure, but let me just comment on some of the points you made. There is a lot of uncertainty
in science, but that doesn't, that's precisely the reason why we should have an approach
to suppress the virus and just drive it down to zero prevalence. And it's not too late,
even though we have hundreds of thousands of cases, it certainly is not too late if
you have a surge in testing and tracing. And this is actually where politics does meet
science. So for example, in the United States, we have about 400,000 to 700,000 tests a day
a day. In order to do a surge in testing, we need to get that to millions a day. And
the best way to do that is actually for the government to spend money and encourage manufacturers
to produce more tests through different incentives to explore different ways to do that using
regional interstate compacts. So there is a role for politics here, and the uncertainty
in science should not stop us from trying to suppress the virus and restore our lives
to normal. So that being said, yes, you know, there is a role for technology. There's also
a role for basic standard disease control. So, you know, TTSI testing, tracing, isolation,
this is a standard practice. This is not a novel idea. And manual contact tracing, which
is low tech, is absolutely critical to that, especially for contacts that are very intimate,
you know, one-on-one interactions, rural areas that don't have huge population prevalence,
you know, huge population density, that may lack access to technology. There is a report
actually by the Financial Times that 2 billion cell phones in the world couldn't even plug
into the iOS slash Apple, sorry, iOS slash Google framework or operating system or has
a requisite low-energy Bluetooth chip in it so it doesn't run down the battery of your
phone when you're doing contact tracing on your phone. So manual contact tracing is critical.
It's essential. It's been, you know, it was done in Taiwan and South Korea. Taiwan manually
contact traced the first 100 cases, and that was critical to, you know, their suppression
and that's a reason why they only have 400 cases. That said, technology can be useful
in certain contexts, and particularly that context of public spaces, right? I mean, it's
very difficult for manual contact tracer to go in through, to track an outbreak that's
happened in a subway car or, you know, that's happened in a confined plaza. So in those
public spaces, technology contact tracing could be useful, but what we really need to
do is be careful about, as Trent alluded to, the privacy-preserving aspect of it. You know,
my view is there's a lot of promise in the Bluetooth peer-to-peer technology. I think
what Apple and Google have rolled out, that's relying on the TCN coalition and DP3T protocols
that has actually gone very far in privacy-preserving technology, but the trick is actually getting
people to voluntarily download those apps without, you know, forcing them to do it.
And we've seen, you know, a challenge in that uptake in places like Auckland and Australia
and Singapore that have tried to roll that out.
What's the, can you just talk about the Bluetooth thing? What's the Bluetooth thing that you
said was promising?
So okay, so there's different ways to do contact tracing using an app, using an app. There's
different models. There's relying on GPS data, so that's your location histories. And then
there's peer-to-peer, what's called exposure notifications, using Bluetooth signals. So
like my Bluetooth signal interacts with your Bluetooth signal. And I believe Apple and
Google, right there, the platform they've developed is our Bluetooth signals are generating
these, you know, random numbers, so it's anonymized. And that model, there's sort of a consensus
around that that model is the most privacy preserving because, you know, GPS location
histories, you can eventually trace where that location history, you know, goes back
to where that, you know, the house, the person eventually keeps going back to. So, well,
you know, the experience in the United States, three states have signed on for Bluetooth
GPS, Bluetooth peer-to-peer exposure warning apps. COVID Watch is, I think, doing a great
job on this. It's run by Tina White, and she's out of Stanford. But we've yet to actually
see, you know, these apps roll out, but really in their early stage phases. And it's still
right on Bluetooth. It only got 20% adoption because it was running down the battery of
phones. It required the phones to be on at all times. Australia, I believe, only got
like five, six million out of, you know, 25 million people. And what you need is 40 to
50% of the population to use one of these apps in order for it to be effective.
Yeah. Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. Maybe Santiago, one for you. Obviously, one of the main worries
about this, the kind of response to the pandemic is that it will be used to kind of justify
a massive increase in executive power in various countries and a massive fall in, you know,
freedoms. What, you know, do you think that that's how big of an issue is that? And are
there any other which kind of countries would you be kind of most concerned about that happening?
I think it's the main criticism coming from the right wing anywhere. The Chinese virus,
right? The consequences more than from the biological layer to the political layer is,
you know, surveillance now has an excuse to advance in every aspect of society. I think
we're still in the middle of the storm. It's very hard to gain perspective and really understand
what's going on. Everyone, at least in my lifetime, it's the first time that I see absolutely
the entire world other than the World Cup or other events like that and the entire world
talking about the same issue facing the same problem. We have this, you know, this curve
metric, this benchmark that is applied to every country and it's being used to evaluate
not only our own country, but how our country compares with other countries. In Argentina,
for example, everyone is comparing the performance and how we are tackling the virus with Brazil
or Chile and the Europe or the US or China itself. Is China telling the truth? Are they
not telling the truth? There's this mutation of society in a more abstract layer of things
that is really interesting that the world is engaging in the most global conversation
we ever had as a global civilization, as a global society. In that sense, the world that
we seem to be engaging after this virus is going to be definitely a much more connected
world in a very strange way where we have more mutual proximity than ever with more
physical distancing than ever. That's another interesting situation that the virus has changed
in our lives. Everyone, how engaging with events and conference and video conferencing
almost in our routine or daily life has really disrupted our way of life, our way of working,
you know, the impact this will have on industries like real estate. There's a lot of transformation
that's going to happen in the social economic aspect. I can only hope for the world having
a much more awareness of the world itself rather than sticking strictly to the local
politics of every country. This is a situation we have seen in the last two months, the growth
of e-commerce is equivalent to the growth of e-commerce in the last 10 years. If this
is only going to happen in commerce, or is it going to even advance in other areas, the
adoption of cryptocurrency or cryptographic protocols for the adoption of new waves of
technologies, virtual reality, all of this stuff is where we seem to be in some kind
of leapfrog, where the acceleration of technologies that were already coming very fast, now they
have significantly accelerated their adoption. I have no memory of something like this happening
and I try to look on the positive side of things. Hopefully we'll end up living in a
society that is more connected, more global, more aware of the global challenges. I want
to be hopeful also with less national frontiers.
I'm going to try to not be triggered by your mentions. You've mentioned blockchain and
so has Trent and you've also mentioned cryptocurrency. I'm going to try not to be triggered by those
because I am not a fan of either. The price of cryptocurrency has gone up in
this process, which is interesting also to see. There has been money printing from the
American government, from every government, and that money printing has gone into equities
in a pretty artificial way, the rise of the stock market, but also it seems to be going
into cryptocurrency. The thesis of stuff like Bitcoin, which is, I have a lot of disagreements
myself with Bitcoin and I argue all day long on Twitter, but the thesis of if the only
government in the world that has not inflated its currency, but actually has deflated its
currency is Bitcoin, whereas all of the other governments keep printing and printing and
printing money and that will have an impact. We shouldn't get into an argument about Bitcoin.
I think we're being drawn to a close, but can I just say Bitcoin is not deflating its
currency, it's still adding currency every 10 minutes, even at a slower rate.
That's true, at a slower rate. So there's no deflation. I think I was going
to ask for some closing remarks, but I think we're being drawn to a close. Oh, we can't
hear you. I think you're on mute again. We still can't hear you. Nope, we can't hear.
There's nothing, there's no noise. Technology, eh? I mean, you can't, it can't do that much
now. We're not hearing anything. Yeah, we need some sign language. Okay, well, I think
in that case, I'll just, we've got some text, sorry, we've got some text. Yeah, okay. So
now there's going to be a Q&A that's going to start in 10 minutes. I should have said
as well that you can post your questions as we kind of held that panel, but there's still
10 minutes, I think, to do that. So do so if you'd like to. And thank you to all three
of you for that. Sorry for pushing back on the crypto thing there at the end. I couldn't
resist. I guess, yeah, I think we've touched on some interesting things. And I think that
the takeaway is just don't do stupid stuff, as Trent said. So thank you all very much.
Welcome back, everybody. You're joining the Web 3.0 stage of COGX 2020. Just to remind
all of you who maybe some of you have been tuning in for the for the whole morning, but
also for those of you just joined, the purpose of this next three days is to actually put
the Web 3.0 development in the context of global problems without getting too stuck
in kind of the decentralized or crypto bubble. So it's been a wonderful day filled with insights,
and we've got so much more lined up for you. And just to remind everyone, this whole stage
has been organized and put together by Fabric Ventures. They are a Web 3.0 focus VC fund.
And yeah, Anastasia and Richard have been working very hard to put all of this in. Yeah,
we hope you're enjoying it so far. Up next, we've got a panel on the dignity preserving
on dignity preserving health care led by Heather Lee Flannery, founder and CEO of Consensus
Health. A little bit about Heather. She builds mission driven organizations aligned by shared
values. And so yeah, we're really excited for this next discussion. And it's the only
health care discussion of the day. So over to you, Heather.
Thank you so much. It's a great honor to be here. Hello, everyone. This this topic of
the intersection between Web 3.0 technologies, privacy, dignity, and all of the elements
that are that our world is experiencing right now is incredibly timely. It's a great honor
in a moment, I will ask my, my esteemed co panelists to introduce themselves briefly
so that you know who I am. In addition to serving as the founder and chief executive
officer of Consensus Health, I also chair the only global standard in development explicitly
at the intersection of blockchain, machine learning and health care and life sciences
at IEEE. And I serve as the co chair of a large professional scientific society, blockchain
task force called HIMS that focuses on transformation, positive transformation of our industry, using
using these technologies. So So with that, I am, I am looking forward to having our panelists
introduce themselves. Let's let's start with the open mind team, Emma.
Hi there, I'm Andrew writing to introduce open mind and then we'll explain our roles.
Yeah, sure. So hi, my name is Andrew. This is Emma. We both work for open mind. So open
mind is an open source community is around 8000 people that focus on making the world
more privacy preserving by lowering the barrier to entry to privacy preserving technologies.
So in short, we're a bunch of privacy people who write open source software for privacy,
particularly privacy preserving machine learning, and then we will focus on education. And so
I lead the organization and do everything from coding and whatever else needs to get
done. And then I lead partnerships and I lead the writing team who runs our blog.
All right, thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, and Dr. Kahana.
Hi, good morning or good afternoon, Heather and to the other panelists and welcome to
all the audience here at COG X. I am Dr. Alex Kahana. I'm the chief medical officer and
lead for the European Middle Eastern African markets at Consensus Health. In terms of background,
I've been in clinical practice as a pain physician for over 25 years. I've been involved in technology
integration in the clinical workflow for over 15 years, and specifically interested in Web
3.0 and distributed ledger technologies in the last five years. One could say that I'm
on a mission to blockchainize healthcare if you want to help provide the crypto space.
This talk today about dignity and privacy that induces dignity is of special interest
to me. I've been in the military for over 16 years and clearly battlefield strips people
from their own dignity. That led me to be, like I said, a practitioner in pain medicine,
which strips dignity themselves, which led me to always want to be involved and utilize
and develop and disseminate technologies that empower the self to maintain that dignity.
So I'm looking forward for a wonderful conversation.
Thank you, Dr. Kahana and Dr. Kepsel.
Thank you and thank you for the invitation. I'm general counsel and ethics and chief ethics
and compliance officer, as well as the Latin America market lead for Consensus Health.
My background is that I've been a lawyer for more than 25 years now, and I'm a philosopher.
I've been a professor of philosophy and practicing public philosophy of sorts for quite some
time. I've led a number of IRB efforts, including creating one at the University of Delft in
the Netherlands and sitting on IRBs at the University of Buffalo. So IRBs are ethics
panels in the United States.
Among the issues that I've fought for and worked for is the issue of ownership of genetic
data. So I wrote a book in 2009 called Who Owns You, which is an argument against the
patenting of naturally occurring genes. I was involved thereafter in drafting amicus
briefs on this issue, that very issue that went up to the Supreme Court in the United
States. And in 2017, I founded a company called Encryption, which built a product that now
allows individuals to take control of their genetic data and to sell it to researchers
in a privacy-preserving manner.
My goodness, it's an honor to be here with all of you. This conversation has the potential
of running for many, many hours, if we allowed it, and it's not going to be simple to unpack
these themes. Here's how I'd like to begin. Before we get into privacy-preserving technology
and how it would work or how it would address the problems that we're all facing that are
very emergent and intense for us, especially right now, let's unpack the problem space.
Why exactly is it that there are strategy in healthcare and life sciences involving
de-identification of data as the primary tactic for preserving privacy in the current state?
All of healthcare and life sciences works on this principle. If you de-identify the
data, then ostensibly the privacy is preserved and our various legal frameworks in jurisdictions
around the world are deemed suitably met. And there is a big elephant in the room, as
they say. And I'd like to unpack that from both a technical perspective and really a
justice perspective, if you will. First on what is wrong with the principle of de-identification
as the argument as to why privacy is preserved. And how did, I'd love to hear from you, Andrew
and Emma, why it is that you decided, because of those problems, to go down the particular
technical path that you've gone down. Yeah, sure. So de-identification, obviously,
while popular, is the first thing that you would think to do if you wanted to preserve
privacy in a document, right? So the notion that I can take a medical document or some
other sensitive document and just remove people's names or self-security numbers and these kinds
of things, and that somehow I am now preserving the privacy of the individuals that I'm redacting.
But unfortunately, as you alluded to, what's been shown is that while your name is one
unique identifier or your date of birth or some other sort of known unique identifiers,
it's really any form of uniqueness in a document can be used to link back to you. And so I
think that one of the most famous cases of this was the Netflix Prize. So for those of
you who are familiar, Netflix ran this machine learning competition where they published
an anonymized data set, right? And this anonymized data set was basically movies and users who
had rated each movie when they watched it. And the Netflix published the data set that
they thought was anonymized because they removed all the names of individuals and all the names
of movies and replaced them with numbers. So all they did was publish this big, big,
big open data set of, you know, this big matrix, right, of movie ratings. And everyone thought,
oh, this is private. This is private. But the problem is, is that a couple of researchers
at UT Austin, within two months, published a paper where they had gone and scraped IMDB.
And then they compared basically each individual row and IMDB with each row that was in the
Netflix data set and were able to identify the individuals who are in the Netflix data
set. So one of the challenges there has been rectified with a newer policy called differential
privacy. And so I think one of the main reasons why we're going down the route of a differential
privacy instead is it actually gives formal mathematical bounds on the probability that
someone will be able to reidentify something as opposed to sort of more of a hand wavy approach
of just moving things around. Yeah. And then in addition, like as you said in the beginning,
it's not just your name that it can be used to identify you. And we're learning more and more
that the actual data that we want to perform, you know, statistics and research on is also the same
data that can identify you. So for example, you can predict somebody, somebody's age from their
brain image, you can predict their sex quite reliably from their brain image. And these are
just medical images. And there's a whole field of research called DNA phenotyping, where you can
reconstruct not only somebody's race, sex, height, weight from their genetic profile, but also you
can reconstruct their face to quite high degree accuracy. So in that sense, you know, if we want
to do research on the genetic profiles, you can't anonymize that, right? So the actual data that we
need is the same data that could identify you. And so the implication here is that we are all
living in a world and in regulatory frameworks that ostensibly preserve our privacy, but those
of us in our field know that that's not actually real any longer. Our privacy isn't preserved
any longer. And it has not been for quite some time. And that's, you know, that's a lot of
what I'd love to hear. Maybe Alex, you could begin in reaction to that. And again, before we
get into solutions, what I'm seeking to do here is really unpack the severity and intensity of
the problem in health care and life sciences. And then we'll move into how it is we can fix it.
Sure. This is a great question. And I think that when I reflect back on the years of where this
whole idea of protecting patients or their identity, and now the limits that we see of
anonymization that actually is not really anonymization and the protection is not
sealed, is really the conceptual flaw that is behind how we're approaching this. If we look
at data as a tool or as a glue for operational processes, we actually strip away the whole idea
or the whole discussion of ownership. And what I would like to argue is that, as I said,
is that data is actually who we are. And hence the discussion on dignity. That I am what I do.
I am my actions. And these actions are captured by data. And this data reflects me. And so when
someone else uses it, loses it, abuses it, sells it, it takes a piece of me. And this, of course,
goes back from a philosophical perspective on, if you wish to go back to Immanuel Kant and the
critique of pure reason, is his categorical imperatives. It's really, we are not allowed,
and we should always reject and prohibit the idea that we can instrumentalize people,
that we treat people as other humans with the respect and dignity that is necessary.
And we do not allow anyone to take pieces of us for their pleasure. And I'm sure that David will
talk from the justice perspective of what we can allow and consent to. And a lot of the current
social turmoil that we're seeing in the world, and I'm here in New York City and it's constant
demonstrations all the time, is really this idea that people are sick and tired of their dignity
being stricken. And the whole, I would say, landscape and world of technology and data,
it's a very insidious and, I would say, undertone place of instrumentalization. And this needs to
stop. And thanks to the solutions that we will mention, this will stop.
Thank you, Dr. Kahana. Dr. Kepsel. Yeah, so Alex really sets the stage for
the tension that we're seeing. And that is, there's an inherent tension between how science
operates and this Kantian notion of dignity. And so Kant is important for this discussion because
this notion of dignity actually ends up in the internationally accepted Belmont principles for
using humans in research. And the fundamental concept is that you can't use people as a means
to an end. You have to treat them as ends in themselves. That's how we talk about that. So
that means they deserve to be treated not as a mechanism or as a tool, but as individuals who
have dignity, who have power, who have autonomy. In science, we collect data and we use data,
often from human subjects, to derive some hypotheses or theories and to eventually lead
to creating technologies that help people. But we have to be careful about how we're using those
subjects in the course of that. And this is the problem. This is why after the Nuremberg trials,
these principles were adopted worldwide. You can't, for instance, experiment on humans without their
consent, without their informed consent. That you have to treat them as individuals who have autonomy,
that you have to use animals first before you experiment on humans, et cetera. So this is an
inherent tension, and scientists didn't always respect the autonomy and dignity of individuals
in their studies, even when they were leading to interesting and useful science. So we have
systems in place, including the justice system, that helps to ensure that the tools we build and
the methods we use are respecting human dignity, and we have processes as well. And now, you know,
we have a massive commoditization of data, which threatens our dignity in a new way, because that
data, that collection, the large-scale collection and use of that data, is also impinging upon
individuals. Dignity threatens to undermine their privacy and, again, treat them as means to ends,
and that's where we stand now.
You know, it's interesting. It comes to mind for me that democratic governments have gone to great
lengths to implement legislation and policy that shares in the aims that all of us are discussing
here. However, most of those ideas are either, they're either dealing in Web 2 as a technical
paradigm, or in the frameworks that you're describing with Belmont. Belmont 2.0 was, when
was that? More than 30 years ago, I believe, but essentially a pre-digital world for all intents
and purposes. So there's, in this intersection, and it is life sciences and health care is a cycle
that functions exceedingly interdependently between the data that is derived from medicine and
health care, the practice of medicine and health care, and data that is created and utilized in
the whole arc of different categories and processes within the life sciences. So we have these
paradigms that are aged in different ways, from completely pre-digital up to Web 2, and there's
really no accommodation in the right now current state about whether we should use these new
families of technologies, how we should use them, and how we could use them in a way that aligns
with the spirit and intent of the voice of the people that has implemented the regulatory
frameworks. It's very clear what the intent is, but the actual lived experience is not as it is
intended today. So a couple of key ideas here that I think we should unpack next is
the fact, really, that without Web 3 technologies, and I'm specifically in this case referring to
the convergence of federated machine learning and blockchain and what that can deliver to this,
it really was a logistic impossibility to achieve the kind of agency, sovereignty, freedom,
and justice that we're talking about in this conversation. And I'd love for those, there may
be members of the audience that aren't familiar with blockchain in any meaningful way, and there's
also people who no doubt are not familiar with federated machine learning in any meaningful way.
Could we do a 15 to 20 second definition of those terms for the audience that might not be with us
on those things? And I'll ask Andrew to do what is federated machine learning at the 15, 20 second
level? And then I'll ask you, David, what is blockchain at the 15 or 20 second level? Just
to baseline there. Andrew?
Yeah, so those of you familiar with machine learning, typically you'll put a data set and
a model into one big machine, and you'll train a model there on examples from the data set.
This usually requires bringing all of your data from wherever it's generated into one location
so you can perform training. So federated learning is a suite of algorithms that instead of forcing
you to sort of bring your data from the edge, from the hospitals, from the phones, or whatever,
into the cloud to do training sort of in one location. You can actually bring the training
down to wherever the data sort of naturally lives or wherever, which is ideally where the data is
known by, so that you don't necessarily have to centralize data in order to be able to train
and train models.
Thank you, Andrew, and powerful implications for that technology. Really, really fundamentally
powerful, as is the case with blockchain. David, what's blockchain, for those on the
line that may not be with us, just briefly?
Sure. So blockchain is also called a distributed ledger, and distributed ledger technologies
allow us to create records, essentially, which can be maintained by a distributed network.
So you don't have a centralized authority, but rather a number of nodes that constantly
ensure that the entries in that ledger are verified, that they are properly entered into
the ledger. And the consensus of the network is what determines whether or not they belong there.
Thank you. And then there's a third concept that plays into this that is not technical
in its conceptualization or its origins, but is a quite literal and direct example of
what the convergence of federated machine learning and blockchain can make possible
that is logistically overwhelmingly complicated today. And that's this idea of the learning
health system, which it does not, again, it doesn't come from engineering ideas. It comes
from within health care. And I'm wondering, Alex, could you just briefly frame up what's
the idea of the learning health system? What are some of its aims and goals?
Sure. I think that, you know, implied in its name, the learning network is that we're leveraging
basically the intelligence of the crowd. And that is really what technology has done.
When you've mentioned beforehand on the legislative framework that is still behind,
it simply has not caught up yet with the capabilities that Web 3 technology and the
convergence of these technologies are giving to us as citizens, as people, as patients. And so we
are actually moving from being, and I've seen this in medicine, where we're not paternalistic
anymore. No one can come into my office and I'll say, you have to do this. They are well
educated by Dr. Google and others. And so we have moved from a human centric world, which
tends to be a little bit paternalistic, to a human driven one, where I am my doctor, I am my
publisher, I am my banker, I am my investor, I am perhaps even my own politician and representative.
So all these tools leverage our abilities to be autonomous, to have that agency and empowerment,
and the network. And then after that, the network of networks are basically the manifestations
of that citizenry, or if you want, patientry, or being that citizen scientist that is seeking
a better life, not only for oneself, but for everyone. And if there's one thing that COVID-19
has shown us, is that we are not independent, we are interdependent. And that we cannot continue
to do stuff in the Western world without paying attention to what that does in the Great South,
or what it does into Pacific Islands, and the other way around, of what it does in the
and the other way around, of what people do in faraway places that impacts what we're doing
in New York City. And so this interdependence bears with us this need to use this crowd
intelligence that is manifested through federated learning and distributed ledger technology,
while at the same time, we make sure that we embed ethics in the design of these technologies
and in the governments and functionality of these technologies, because none of us,
at the end of the day, is as good as all of us. Absolutely. The notion of ethically intentional
design of emerging technology is critically important. And so I want to take this to you,
Emma, for a second, but I want to tie it in with something that Drs. Kahana and Kepsel commented
upon. Dr. Kepsel mentioned tensions between ostensibly equally important priorities.
If we go back into our history, we see the tension between liberty and freedom and security has
played out in civilization after civilization and continues to play this now. And right now,
that's data sovereignty versus safety, in this case, pandemic response and safety from disease.
You have a background in health care and particularly in life sciences.
Emma, I'd love to hear from you the way that the technology that the open source technology
that Open Mind is propagating specifically gets at the ability to resolve that tension. That's
the fundamental thing here. We're not advocating to fail in our scientific and population health
goals so that we can preserve our privacy. We're arguing that we can succeed at both
in a brand new way. Could you suss that out a little bit more for us? How does the technology
that you're working on get us there? Yeah, well, I think it helps to split the problems
that we're talking about into two problems. So there's the issue of too much uncontrolled
access to data, which I think is a lot of what you're talking about with dignity and just big
data in general and the problems that that has brought on. But then at the same time, scientists
like me, we a lot of the time don't have enough access to the important data for the problems
that we want to solve. So often a hospital won't have enough of a certain type of cancer scan or
anything like that, where you can actually use deep learning or machine learning methods to solve
those problems. We use other methods. And so those are those are two different problems,
not enough data, and then also too much access to data. And the tools that Open Mind works on
using federated learning, differential privacy, and encrypted computation is actually the tool
that can solve both trade offs. So at the same time, it can allow us to have, you know, our apps
or all the various predictive tools that we like without having to give up our data, without our
data being, you know, shipped off of our phones and things like that. And also, it can now make
it possible for researchers to more easily have access to the data that they want to study.
While preserving, you know, basically going over that hurdle of, you know, I want to study on data
that's really sensitive, maybe it's data that we definitely don't want to store in one big data set
or release in one big open access bio bank, right. So Open Mind builds free libraries that everybody
can use. And it just extends the popular machine learning frameworks. So those of you who are
familiar, PyTorch or TensorFlow, and it makes it really easy for non-privacy experts to use these
tools properly and preserve privacy in their machine learning practice. So it's always
positioned as this trade off. But now that we have tools for this, it doesn't have to be a trade off.
We can't have both.
Yes. And what an interesting thing it's going to mean for our society for factions that are so
accustomed to arguing with one another indefinitely to be able to depolarize the dialogue by
fundamentally meeting the needs of all the stakeholder groups. Yeah, it's a remarkable
precipice upon which we're standing right now, that we are about to be able to make this happen.
And the world doesn't yet know it. The world is still ready to have their same old fights
and keep on pulling that tug of war, pull that rope back and forth. And so blockchain technology
brings in, meets a number of needs that remain after the problems that the open mind stack is
providing. If we want, for example, to have an immutable tamper resistant, very detailed record
of every consent that was ever granted, to whom and when, and for exactly what purpose, that is a
classic scenario for blockchain that would be difficult to implement in other manners in ways
that would be equally trustworthy and tamper resistant and secure. And there are other
implications too. And let's for a moment, I'll invite both Drs. Kahana and Kepsel to provide
an implication for the convergence and intersection of the advanced privacy preservation,
and verifiable computation, et cetera, with blockchain technologies. Maybe
Alex, if you could speak to the implications of tokenization generally, and some things about
incentivization, and then we'll go to you next, Dr. Kepsel.
Well, you're definitely a mind reader. And as I was listening to Emma, really speaking about
this false narrative that we have to give up everything in order to be safe, and we have to
give up not only our privacy, but our economic activity, really she speaks to the idea of lack
of economic incentives to transact. And the reason is because in our growth-obsessed capital
markets that we live in, that are very centralized, there is a gravitation towards monopoly and
monopsony. And so what happens is that really, it is creating an exclusionary economy where people
just don't feel part of it. That is part of the resentment that we are witnessing on a daily basis.
I cannot participate in this. So this is where the magic of blockchain really is. Because a lot of
people ask me about blockchain, and they say, well, you know, there's a lot of people who are
asking me about blockchain and talk about the features that both you and David mentioned
earlier, and veracity and the authentication and verification and single source of truth,
and all these things that, you know, like a general purpose technology makes things, you know,
faster, cheaper, better, and reduce friction. But the true magic really is this peer-to-peer
economic activity that can be translated into digital assets that have no borders,
that are not, you know, stymied or disincentivized by states or different stakeholders,
that perhaps, you know, the hospital and the physician, we do not have the same
incentives to do things. And so, again, part of the Web 3.0 tools is to allow me to be that
independent, dignified agent that is capable to reach out to other people. So if I am a knowledge
seeker, I can go to a knowledge provider without asking permission from a third party to do it.
And that secret provider can actually give me that knowledge without asking permission
from a third party to actually provide me that information. And the price of that transaction
will actually be determined by the true price discovery that happens in the market, and not
defined by centralized monopolist or monopsonic forces. So this is really the democratization,
not only of knowledge, which the Web 2.0 did so well, but actually the democratization of value
to create an inclusionary economy for everyone that has fractional ownership, both in the
intellectual capital that is developed, but also in the social and economic capital that is available.
Extremely well said, Dr. Kahana. And Dr. Kepsel, so I know you're also very passionate about
those same themes that Dr. Kahana was just mentioning. One we haven't surfaced yet that I
don't think it would be right to wrap this panel up without addressing is so foundational, is this
matter of identity, and for the learning health system, and for this phrase, patient-centered,
or human-centered, patient-centered design of health care delivery systems.
And both the learning and the delivery of care and the preservation of dignity comes down to
identity and also the ability to choose not to disclose one's identity. This is another
key convergence point of Web 3.0 technologies. Could you comment on that, please?
Oh, sure. Yeah, so this is a big topic. I know.
Now, identity is actually a fascinating sociological artifact because it is something
that we often take for granted, but that plays a huge role in all our interactions with each other
and with our governments and as we travel, et cetera. So being able to say you are who you are,
to claim ownership of a particular identity is a privilege, really, that many people don't share
in. So I wanted to reflect on the work of the economist, Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto,
who's done a lot of work on the problems that the very poorest people in the world, well, which is
a couple billion people in the world, really, have in accessing what he calls trapped capital.
So it turns out there's trillions of dollars of value that people are creating for which they
cannot realize any gain, and he calls this trapped capital. So the very poorest people in the world
working on land that isn't legally theirs, but they're improving or they're creating something
from don't have a mechanism to go to their states and say, this is mine, because they lack a
because they lack identification, because they lack the recognition by the state of who they are
and why they own what they own. And this, it seems to me, based on what we've been
talking about today, that your access to this claim of who you are
needs to be decentralized to prevent the sort of monopolistic problems that states create and
partake in by, you know, being the final say about what it is, what it is you own and who it is you
are and how you can express yourself. And these decentralized solutions provide us access to
access to liberating value and liberating and providing dignity for billions of people around
the world, giving them that ability to take control, to basically to show a title for
ownership in their selves, in their identities is a tremendously important possibility
that is created by the technologies we're talking about today. So for Hernando de Soto, his
Institute for Liberty and Democracy, they're going around educating states about how to create value
in your economies by giving access to the poorest people to ways to claim for themselves title
to things, including themselves, so that, you know, we can realize more value, we can all share in the
creation of new types of economy and lift all boats with this rising tide. And that's the same,
we think, for medical information and your clinical information as well as your
identification through documents and history.
Thank you, Dr. Capsule. You know, that's an excellent segue into a couple of additional
technical concepts that I think we need to unpack and explain their implications so that this is
coming full circle of how these philosophic and moral ideas directly are enabled and made possible
by different pieces of Web 3. So I'd love to describe why it is that verifiable computation
is important and what if you can't trust the hardware or the executable that's running some
kind of process? And what does verifiable computation mean? And then what's zero
knowledge cryptography? And why is that important in this? And why is it an equally revolutionary
idea as federated learning is that you defined earlier, you know, performing the learning on the
data at its point of origination and so on. So can you unpack colleagues from Open Mind? I'll let you
decide, you know, how you divide that subject up. But can you speak to those additional technologies
and how critical they are to this picture? Yeah, sure. So you listed two things. One was encrypted
computation. The other one was zero knowledge proofs. So encrypted computation, just to link
it, so it comes in a few different forms. So if you're familiar with secure multi-party computation
you might have heard of or homework encryption. I think it's probably the most popular functional
encryption and then zero knowledge proofs is sort of related. Of course, like secure hardware,
like so if you've heard of SGX, all these sounded like, you know, a bunch of really big heavy
sounding words, but they all exist at a high level to do kind of the same thing, which is
allow multiple different individuals to collaboratively compute, right, and compute
some function together while keeping all their contributions to that function secret. So the
idea being that, let's say, you know, Emma and I want to, you know, I had some data, she had some
data, or maybe I have some data and she has a machine learning model, or basically, you know,
it's in software, like, you know, she has some variables, I have some variables, and we want to
be able to perform some sort of computation, whether that's machine learning or basic statistics or,
you know, a database query or diagnosis, whatever, right, when we run some program together and we
want to keep our inputs to that program secret, and we only want to publish perhaps the output
of the program, or sort of the result of our computation together. And so there's sort of
the suite of input privacy, what's called input privacy, or encrypted computation, all allow you
to do it through various trade-offs. So home morph encryption does this quite well using a sort of
public-private key form of encryption that tends to require more compute. Secure multi-party
computation uses a slightly different set of algorithms that tends to require more network
overhead, and then secure hardware does this by actually using techniques at the hardware level
as opposed to the software level. Functional encryption and, like, zero-knowledge groups
are just other variants of this. So basically, the idea is, like, this sort of cluster of algorithms
all are trying to accomplish kind of the same high-level thing, which is allow multiple people
to compute something together without having to sort of make public their inputs to everyone else
in the group in order to be able to do computation. But they just have different trade-offs in terms
of which scenarios they work best in. So, like, for example, home morph encryption works well if
you don't have access to, say, fast network connections, but you have access to a GPU, right?
Secure multi-party computation works well if you have really fast network access. Secure hardware
is kind of like, if you can't do either of these things and you happen to have access to one of
these, you know, Intel SGX chips or something like this, you can do that. Zero-knowledge proofs is an
interesting sort of cousin or close cousin of these techniques. Specifically, zero-knowledge
proofs allows me to ask, say, Emma to compute a function using my information, and then when
she gives me the result, she can also give me a proof that she ran it on the function that she
said that she was. So, for example, let's say Emma had a machine learning model that could predict
whether an image had skin cancer in. So, I could take a picture of my arm, right, and I could give
it to Emma. Emma could run a prediction through this using some form of zero-knowledge proof,
give me back the prediction, and with an extra proof, you know, a little piece of cryptography
that says, oh, and you actually did use the machine learning model that you said that you
did to generate this prediction, right? So, again, it's highly related to these other techniques,
and it's still all about making it so that, in this case, Emma can keep her inputs private
while still being able to prove to me that she did the computation she said she did when I wasn't
able to actually see it myself. Well, thank you very much, and as predicted this conversation
has gone so quickly, I'd like to let all of the audience members know that we are enthusiastically
participating in a 45-minute panelist Q&A that starts in another 15 minutes, and we're excited
to engage with you, the audience, on your questions and reactions to all the issues at hand.
So, if you could join us in 15 minutes, and then before I wrap, if I could just invite each of my
esteemed co-panelists to offer a, you know, 10-second or less closing remark. Let's go Andrew,
Emma, Dr. Kepsel, Dr. Kahana. Thank you all for your attention, and I hope you look
deeper into privacy preserve to come. You can find us on slack.openmind.org.
Thank you all. I think we have a lot to do, and I'm excited to work with anybody who wants to
reach out to us at Consensus Health or to me personally and talk about these issues.
And it was a pleasure having a conversation here. Just remember,
dignity is a new concept. The French Revolution was not ͧalit̬ libert̬ dignit̮ And remember
that we can know everything, but at the end, the thing that we don't know, the thing that is left
beyond that we know everything, is our dignity. So maintain our dignity and maintain your dignity
and practice radical empathy because we need it nowadays. Thank you. Thank you, all of you,
and audience, we are excited to continue to engage with you for 45 minutes,
starting after a 15-minute break. Thank you so much.

Welcome back, everybody. We've got another exciting panel for you in the next few minutes.
The real question we're going to be asking ourselves right now is, is our economy doomed?
And to lead us into the next discussion, I'm very pleased to welcome Kenneth Kukier,
Senior Editor of The Economist and the host of the weekly podcast on technology Babbage.
He's also the co-author of the New York Times bestselling book Big Data. So over to you, Kenneth.
Great. Thank you very much, Samantha. So is the economy doomed? I mean, it's a question that we all want to ask, but of course, we're all very grateful that we are still healthy, if we are still healthy, and we hope that we are.
Apparently, it's clear that we have gone from a health crisis to an economic crisis and now to a social crisis, working out on the street and Black Lives Matter suggests that a lot of the pent up anger at a system that feels broken to many people is being expressed in the street.
And it's happening, of course, when it comes to racial injustice in the United States and elsewhere, everywhere else, in fact. It's happening when it comes to the treatment of health care, of who gets what and who is susceptible to danger.
And now the focus of our panel today is looking at what all those things mean for the economy, because the same inequalities that we see for people taking to the street in Manhattan and in Minnesota and Minneapolis.
And the same injustices that we're seeing when it comes to the health care sector around the world, we're now going to face for the economy.
The economy is not immune to those same inequalities, and what it means for the future is up in the air.
The things that are going to be no brainers, things that we're kind of pretty certain the world's going to look like post-COVID when it comes to economics, and there's things that reasonable people can argue about.
But what those are aren't quite so clear. The good news is that we've got an extraordinary panel today with which to talk about them.
On the panel is Ryan Selkis. He is the founder and CEO of Misari, a cryptocurrency company.
We've got Anthony Painter, the chief of research and impact officer at the Royal Society of Arts and Manufacturers.
And we have Rune Christensen, the founder and CEO of MakerDAO.
I'm not going to try to explain to you what it is. He will do a better job of it. I'm sure I'll get it wrong.
And whatever there's something with the word maker in it and the word DAO in it, I run it the other way.
And of course, we have Alexandria Musma-Vizadeh, who is the director of research for Tortoise Media.
Hello, Alexandra. And to the entire panel, welcome.
Let me start us off with thinking about this by concentrating our minds and asking the question that most people are trying to suss out for themselves,
whether as members of the public, employees, business managers, investors, citizens.
And that is how will the post-COVID economy be different?
So why don't we start with you, Alexandra?
Right. OK. I mean, I've got a few hats that I'd like to wear for this discussion.
As you know, I'm an economist. I'm actually a Danish economist.
I've spent my career as a sovereign analyst looking at the world through risk and debt sustainability.
And I started my career with the Asia crisis in 97. I walked through the Russia default.
I've been through, obviously, the financial crisis and municipal crises and looked at structured finance and all that.
But from a macro perspective, you know, this is, you know, what is the closest we can compare to?
And that, you know, and I'm sure you would agree, Ken, that would be the financial crisis of 08.
But still with that, you know, this is much deeper and much more abrupt and affecting so many things,
not only just the economy and supply chains, but also the way we live.
Right. So there's a whole different set of circumstances around this financial crisis.
And I guess what really worries me is that with the defaults that I've lived through and even with the financial crisis,
what has usually been ropes that you could throw out to countries to help them was debt relief of some kind,
it would be an IMF that could step in, there's fiscal stimulus that can support.
But with the whole world going into this kind of depression or crisis, you know, where are the ropes that are going to be thrown?
These have got to be born from domestic, you know, from homegrown.
How are we going to stimulate an economy that is going to provide the kind of growth that's going to absorb the high, high levels of unemployment?
That's also something that concerns me with so little ropes out there.
And yeah, go ahead. Sorry.
Oh, I just want to pick up on that.
And I'm going to bring you back in, but I want to pick up on that, the sort of report that we can offer,
because Anthony Painter has been thinking a lot about these structural holes in society.
He might be very interested to know what he thinks about how Covid is exposing some of these existing problems
and what the future might look like.
How can we use this as an opportunity to build something that we feel is more sustainable?
Yeah, I think in terms of fundamental terms, the immediate future will look very, very similar to the immediate past.
And that's that I think looking at from a sort of individual community and even national level,
we're faced with a series of sort of stark choices between economic security and maintaining that,
maintaining our health, individual and public health, and maintaining our ability to care for those close to us,
our community, our nations and the global community.
And these are sort of stark choices that fall very heavily on particular groups in periods of instability of which there are frequent occurrences.
As Alexander mentioned, the crash now have a public health crisis in the form of Covid, what's next?
It's something of automation, climate change, you mentioned social and cultural injustice issues that are bubbling along.
We're very prone to destabilisation, it seems to me, and we don't have the stabilisers that are strong enough in place.
So what are the things that we need to do in order to put a floor of foundation under people, communities and countries
so we can better weather these shocks, which I suspect are going to be quite frequent and with us over a period of time?
So what does a social contract look like from an individual perspective? Does it involve something like a universal basic income?
Does it involve better access to training and support, job activation, job guarantees?
These debates are very live and important.
And from a community perspective, how can we ensure that places that are disconnected at risk,
and this is going to really hit home in the coming months, of course, as recession really takes hold,
we've weathered the early stages of it, but it's going to become more turbulent and severe.
So how do we get cash and support into communities in the right way so they can withstand the pressures of what they're about to experience?
And at every level, we're experiencing it. Of course, it's not just places and individuals, it's particular groups that will experience it.
We've had the data right now about COVID and its impact on minority communities, partly that's because of their economic circumstances,
the type of jobs they may be likely to do in transportation, health care, retail distribution, warehousing.
Women, particularly lone parents, face these stark choices in even more extreme ways than many others.
So that stark choices, destabilization, but over the longer, medium to longer term,
how we can withstand that are a series of sort of policy and political choices that we need to consider and make differently.
So, Rune, you've been thinking about this as well from the point of view of an entrepreneur, as well as you, Ryan.
How do you look at the world post-COVID and think about what role you're going to play as business leaders?
Rune, you want to kick off?
Yeah. So I think that it is absolutely true that the world went into these cascading calamities, essentially.
And I actually remember that right before COVID hit, I was at Davos, the World Economic Forum,
and I was listening to all these business leaders talk about how, well, this time there's not going to be a crisis, right?
There's not going to be a crash. And everyone was like extremely feeling, extremely optimistic and sort of like, you know, in hindsight,
obviously that was a sign that things weren't really as great as, you know, as we now know.
And it's clear that the economic system has just been going in a wrong direction that left it very vulnerable to this kind of issue of,
you know, global health crisis that suddenly means that there's not enough protective equipment for anyone
because of just-in-time logic being implemented for health care in many places and just other,
you know, these less than ideal choices that have been made that ultimately ended up,
I think, impacting the people who are already worse off much more severely than, you know, those who are in a privileged position, right?
And then that's resulted in a lot of the anger and a lot of this feeling that the system is rigged against everyone, right?
And when people in crypto and really people working at blockchain, we all come from that perspective,
or most of us come from that perspective because when you, crypto and blockchain itself was created out of the last financial crisis, right?
That happened, the last one, right? More than a decade ago at this point, but it's basically the same story, right?
That like the leaders and the elites took the economy and sort of the world in a particular direction and didn't go so well.
And then you get things like, you know, unemployment and terrible situation for most people around the world, but bailouts as well, right?
And too big to fail. And, you know, we're seeing the exact same thing happening now
where the world's richest have actually been profiting massively from the pandemic, right?
And from the economic crisis and they've been adding billions to their wealth.
And it, in my opinion, it all comes down to, I mean, it really does come down to that the structures as they exist today
because of their ultimately their centralized nature, right?
The fact that these structures and the governments and the nations even and companies and everything is built by, you know,
in this hierarchical fashion where someone sits at the top or some group controls ultimately and administers the system.
And it's just, I mean, as we all know, power corrupts, right?
It's impossible for these kind of structures over time to not slowly, you know, increasingly become unequal
and create a greater benefit for those that actually are at the top and where blockchain aimed to solve this
and which is, you know, where if you look at something like Bitcoin, the original version of bludgeon, right?
It's very basically by injecting, you know, especially by injecting transparency and by creating systems
that through transparency can actually guarantee fairness, right?
That they function exactly the same way for everyone, which I actually think that's step one.
It's not really, you know, I don't think that necessarily.
Well, I mean, it's something to be considered, right?
But it's not just that we need special treatment necessarily or we need measures to help people, right?
But in the first step is really just building something that's fair for everyone.
OK, before I let Ryan weigh in and we hear from him, I would want to challenge that.
Maybe Ryan can reply to this, respond to this.
You know, I'm all in on the whole decentralization thing.
You know, give me an economic system, love it decentralized, call it the invisible hand.
And today we'll call it the blockchain, right?
Give me a political regime. Don't want a monarchy. Love decentralization.
Give it, I'll call it democracy. I'm all in favor.
But in a health care crisis like COVID where you need a vaccine and you need public authorities
or probably you need public authorities, that's the question, to distribute it,
it seems like this is a sort of absolute textbook historical example where it shows the benefit of centralization.
I can't imagine how you'd ever have any effective response without a form of centralization
in either the production or in the invention, production and distribution of health care resources,
whether it's for treatment, whether it's for a vaccine, whether it's for taking in people
and adjudicating them to nightingale hospitals.
So it's interesting that I think that we might see a shift towards centralization in certain areas.
I mean, we're certainly doing that in terms of track and trace.
You know, crypto might work under the hood to guarantee security, might,
but you're going to need a centralized authority to sort of run the system.
But maybe I'm wrong.
Ryan, do you want to respond to what Ru has said and to the general question or do you want to respond to my flight of fancy?
I'll respond to your flight of fancy because it's going to be much more fun for me.
Centralized authorities in China and the U.S. internationally were abject failures in this crisis.
And in fact, the only reason it wasn't much worse is because you had rational people
pushing back on the nonsensical notion that things like masks didn't work.
So, you know, I think anyone that trusts the U.S. government or the Chinese government at this point,
I have to question what they've been reading, what they've been watching for the last decade.
And if you think about vaccines, you think about coordination of some of these solutions,
primarily that has been done at the local and state level more effectively.
And in the private sector has been done more effectively by publicly funded biotech companies and other health organizations.
So when you talk about the coordination issue of ensuring that when we do have a vaccine,
it gets mass produced and ultimately becomes available very, very rapidly.
I think it's still an open question whether world governments are going to be efficient coordinating bodies
and that they won't just become corrupted and ultimately choose the winners and losers
in terms of who gets first access to those therapeutics.
So generally speaking in this crisis, I think the free market has done better.
The decentralized information apparatus has done better.
And the state versus federal system that we have in the U.S. has ultimately produced different outcomes.
But you've seen in some cases states really get it right, like California and the West Coast,
whereas others that have taken complete opposite tracks like Florida, at least until recently, and Texas,
they've done just as well by following a completely different tack.
So I don't think in a scenario like this where no one really knows what's going on with a health crisis,
even at this point, it makes sense to just put all of our faith in any centralized institution,
whether it's the CDC, the WHO, or a national government.
Okay. So let me now have you take that view, point taken, and move it up the field one step ahead and think about the post-COVID economy.
What do you expect it to look like?
Well, I think it's going to accelerate trends that were already preexisting.
On the one hand, I think you've had a recent move over the last several years towards more autarkic nationalist ethos
with respect to how different countries are managing their economies and their supply chains.
This is certainly going to be an accelerant to that.
I think folks in the U.S. and in Europe have recognized that they can't be utterly dependent on China
and the Chinese Communist Party for critical components of their supply chain.
So you see a renationalization of some of those and an emphasis towards actually building versus just consuming
and being reliant on a global supply chain, which is in and of itself a form of systemic leverage.
On the other hand, I think you're going to continue to see tech companies get bigger.
You're going to continue to see a march towards virtualization of everything.
A lot of trends that people have been talking about for a while, work from home, the gig economy, automation.
I think those are just put into hyperdrive.
So from a social level, will we see something akin to a universal basic income
or other experiments like that start to come online as there are more rapid disruptions of existing jobs
within the kind of traditional economy and a very limited window for people to get, quote, unquote,
retrained or prepare for the next wave of growth that comes out of the post-virus economy?
So to all the panelists, I pose the question, what do we expect recovery to look like?
Do we expect it to be a very long, almost like Great Depression's kitchen environment for several years?
Or do we think that provided that there's no other calamity like a war or a nuclear accident
or some other thing that would be exogenous to what would otherwise be a recovery,
or do we think that there's something new about 21st century capitalism, that it has a resiliency
that we have not actually put into play before, but actually it exists,
and we're going to see the economy recover, not entirely to the pre-COVID level, but not too far off either,
and that it might not look V-shaped, like a bungee jump, bungee cord, but it'll be a U-shaped,
and we're looking at maybe a quarter or two, as things ease up, and they're starting to ease up now,
whether too early or not, what do you think, long or short, deep or shallow?
So I actually think that, oh, sorry.
So I think for me, actually, the more important question isn't whether the economic growth,
as in GDP and the novel statistics that we're so used to track, whether that instantly jumps back or not.
That's not really the important question.
The important question is whether this new growth will be based on more sustainable
and more long-term views about how we should build up our world, right?
Because the reason why we got here in the first place was ultimately because of these relatively short-sighted decisions
that were made because of the issues that exist with how the systems are currently set up, right?
And so I think that there's a case to be made for decentralized finance and blockchain technology,
and basically like a new way of technology being used in rebuilding society following this.
And I mean, I think we're already seeing now during the lockdown and the crisis itself,
we're seeing companies turning to innovative technology to try to mitigate the impacts.
And we're seeing things like companies turning remote because they have to anyway because of the lockdown,
and then they realize the benefits of it.
And I mean, typically it is in times of adversity that you learn to use new tools and learn to try new things
and then actually benefit from it, right?
And that's the process of evolution, which I believe that that's what will happen this time.
Okay. Let me see if Alex is here to talk about debt. What about the debt crisis?
Can you hear me?
Yes, please.
Okay. I lost sound there for a second, but I can hear you, Ken.
You're on.
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you, Roon, but I think that in terms of you're asking,
what would this be like? U-shape or what do we think is going to emerge out of this and how resilient are we?
So I think you look at the Nordic model, right?
And you see that those are the countries, and I know they're small and homogenous and easier to manage,
but you mentioned sort of systems that are centralized.
And I agree that the China-U.S. models are not ideal as models to follow now.
But if you look at the Scandies, fault lines have been less severe.
The disruptive impact on their economies have been less severe, and that is because there are cushions in place,
supportive system transfers to those who need a well-funded health care system,
all the things that were really critical in order to meet this crisis set on.
And it was interesting to see the Norwegian Prime Minister come out and say that they were not certain
that the lockdown was a good idea from the get-go.
But I mean, it's very hard to know exactly what the right thing to do is in terms of the health care risks.
And it's a small country, so maybe their risk of infection would have been much smaller
because it's a smaller country than a big country like the U.S.
But the question would be, what kind of models are we going to try and become out of this
when we regather after the crisis, what are we going to be pushing for, right?
So, you know, clearly, as has been said here on the panel, these fault lines have emerged clearly.
And the economy, from health to the economy to the social structures of society are becoming,
you know, the issues there are becoming very clear.
So, you know, as the economy grows and is it able to absorb the unemployed?
And probably not to the extent that it was pre-crisis.
So what do we do with the sort of a remainder of high unemployment rates?
You know, how do we as a society tackle that?
And, you know, maybe it's the point in time where we sort of dig out the sort of all routes lead to Norway or Denmark
and give us something that we can learn from that.
Thank you, Alex.
Let me turn to Anthony and ask you, what do we do?
You've been thinking about this for a long time.
Well, I just want to pick up the question of debt.
And we've all grown up in an environment where debt was something to be feared, something to be managed down.
You know, it was something where you put limits on and you'd only turn to an absolute extremist and crisis.
But doesn't it feel like we're in a completely different environment now?
I mean, monetary authorities, the ECB, Bank of England, Federal Reserve, whatever,
now are basically sort of gone from sort of quantitative easing, even into sort of monetisation of government debt,
which we were told would be a complete catastrophe if it was ever to happen.
It was impossible. It was mad policy. We're in that territory.
Why don't we think about it in a different way now?
Rather than just thinking about debt as something we turn to an extremist to manage crisis,
why don't we think about it as a means to manage a transition to a different type of economy?
How can we use the ability to accumulate debt on a public level to manage a transition to something which is about better work,
which is about climate change, it is about sort of investing in companies,
taking a foothold in companies and communities that can help us manage that transition?
I wonder if there's a more positive conversation to be had about debt.
It could be a very public conversation and actually could start to put in place some of the bedrocks of our wealth,
our wealth that isn't sort of tempered by damage to people and planet in quite the same way.
And we use debt in that quite more imaginative way.
And we're honest about that rather than waiting for the next calamity, the next destabilisation period to hit
and then having to use debt again to manage crisis rather than to manage transition.
That's beautifully stated.
Let me put a little gasoline on those flames and ask about universal basic income,
because so many people are looking at this moment and thinking, well, that's the answer, is it?
It's part of it.
And the thing about universal basic income is it puts a floor underneath people.
It's there. You can rely on it. You know that it's there.
And part of the problem in the past few months has been people feared where anything was there at all.
And a lot of people have found that there was absolutely nothing.
And the thing about universal basic income, it just gives you a foothold,
one, which you can manage your short-term income needs,
but two, you can start to think about your future as well.
So it's part of it. It's not the whole solution by any means.
It's a lot more required than that, but it's one of the foundation stones, I would say.
So now let me, we only have about four minutes left, three minutes.
So let me now turn to Ryan and Rune to ask them what their view is of these sort of measures,
whether it's debt or universal basic income, to take the sharp edges off of the crisis that we face.
Yeah, I would really like to, you know, again, make the case a little bit for decentralized finance,
which is this new emerging space in blockchain that's not so well known outside of blockchain just yet,
but it's very, very hot inside the space.
And if you look at my project Maker, which I co-founded five years ago and which is now one of the largest,
well, it's the leading DeFi project.
What we're doing is we've created a completely autonomous blockchain native system
that essentially enables people to get access to decentralized currency.
So a stable currency that's worth one dollar, but it's not guaranteed by a bank or held by a custodian or something like that.
And then the creation of this decentralized currency then also naturally creates decentralized finance
because the value of this currency has to be sourced from somewhere, right?
And then the allocation of this stability into different asset classes,
in my opinion, does provide this exact opportunity that Anthony is talking about, right?
That we can use these new technologies and use new forms of finance to then essentially seed the new economy, right?
A more sustainable model that can take us in a new direction that isn't just going to lead us to our next crisis and our next crisis again and again,
but instead, among other things, by including transparency into this, right?
Letting people know what their money is actually backing and where that capital is actually going.
I think we can go in a much better direction.
Ryan, I want to give you the last word.
How do you see these trends?
Well, before this question, you had asked if I could take the edge off of the conversation.
And the fact of the matter is I don't think that's possible.
I've been in Bitcoin and crypto for about eight years now.
And the reason I've been in is because I believe in the strong need for people to have an alternative to the existing financial system and the existing national debt system.
If you look back at the history of currencies, the average reserve currency lasts about 110, 120 years.
The average currency in general dies after about 40 years.
So what we're doing in building a parallel financial system is ultimately giving people a life raft when some of these long-term debt cycles inevitably turn,
whether that's in emerging markets, whether that's in the US, whether that's a breakdown of the eurozone.
There will be an alternative for folks to exit and at least maintain a portion of their wealth and portfolio in a sensor resistant regime
that they will be able to replug in anywhere globally once the dust has settled in their particular economy.
So I think that's important. I think it's a little bit, it might sound fatalistic, but if you look at history,
we've gone through these transitions dozens, hundreds of times, and people generally survive, come out the other side.
This is just a way to streamline that transition in the event that things go sideways.
Okay. So thank you, Ryan, but also let me thank everyone, Alexandra, Ruin, and Anthony, and to say that although the panel is ending now,
we will be back at four o'clock for a Q&A session.
So if you go to the COGX homepage and look at all the information where you can click,
you can find out how to chat with us and ask us questions in 30 minutes' time.
Thank you very much to all the panelists, and thank you, Kenneth, for leading us into that discussion.
And yes, as Kenneth wrapped up, just make sure if you have any questions, just pop it in the Q&A poll, and yeah, they'll be back on at four o'clock.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, guys.
I'm super excited to introduce Laura Shin, the host of the next session.
Laura is one of the most inquisitive journalists and podcast hosts I've heard, so we're certainly in for an exciting discussion.
The group will discuss Bitcoin as the store value and an asset that is an alternative to the money printing as we have going on today.
Laura, welcome on stage and excited for the session.
Hi, everyone. I'm the host of two crypto podcasts, Unchained and Unconfirmed.
I am a journalist who's been covering crypto for five years, actually.
This is literally my five-year anniversary, maybe about last month.
And the two guests that we have today are two people that are going to be discussing a topic that's actually a little bit controversial,
and yet at the same time, quite of the moment, I would say, given what's going on with the pandemic and some of the quantitative easing that we've seen in response to the shutdowns.
And here to discuss are Jameson Lopp, who's the co-founder and CTO of Casa, and Matt Luongo, the founder and CEO of Keep.
Welcome, Jameson and Matt.
Hi, thanks for having me.
So the three of us know each other from the crypto space.
But I wonder if, you know, perhaps maybe a few of these attendees at this conference are from outside the crypto world.
So why don't we start with a brief description of your companies and what you do in the space?
Jameson, do you want to begin?
Sure. So I recently passed my five-year mark full time in the Bitcoin space as well.
I've been focusing on security and really what we do at Casa is we help people empower themselves.
We help them to actually attain the promise that Bitcoin has made for a decade, which is that you can be your own bank.
Unfortunately, what I've learned in the five years that I've been working in the space is that it is incredibly difficult to do that.
And what we're doing is we're building technology that is leveraging a lot of security aspects and best practices
that we've learned through a lot of hard lessons over the years and putting a really nice user interface on top of it
so that we're drastically reducing the technical requirements in order to build a what I call better than bank grade vault.
And Matt, I think when I introduced you, I said keep, but I meant thesis. I'm sorry. You have your hands in multiple different things in Bitcoin and crypto.
So why don't you explain that for everybody?
Yeah, sure. So I just got my six-year chip. I started in the space launching a company called Fold.
And eventually I started working more on the deeper engineering side, launching another project called Keep.
We put all of this under one umbrella, which is thesis, a production studio.
But basically what brings me to space and what we're working on is empowering individuals.
So that means a wide variety of things, you know, most relevant to this conversation.
It means empowering them to opt out of our economy, opt out of central planning, opt out of the Fed.
But it also means escaping surveillance capitalism and really just, you know, moving to a social model
where people need to say yes before they're taken advantage of and signed up for something.
So high level, that's the sort of projects we're working on in thesis.
And then relevant to this, we've recently launched a Bitcoin to Ethereum bridge.
And so I think I've got kind of an interesting take on money versus technology in the space and what I think Bitcoin can do post-COVID.
So to kick off our discussion, I actually just want to parse the title of this fireside chat.
And let's just start with the beginning, monetary maximalism. How do you guys define that?
Well, really, you know, when we're talking about money, we're talking about a network, you know,
a means by which you can transfer value or say, you know, who owes who what within a given society or ecosystem.
And, you know, one of the results of networks is that their utility increases as the size of the network grows.
So there is a general thesis that we see, you know, not only in finance, but in technology in general,
that we want to see a given technology grow and expand to the point that it becomes the primary network
through which people are using that technology rather than having a fragmented series of many smaller networks
that in aggregate are probably of lower total value. So the same thing is what is going to happen with money,
we believe, as money becomes more competitive. You know, to this point for the past several hundred,
if not thousand years, money has mostly been based upon, you know, nation states or regions of nation states that come together.
So I think it's a really interesting question when we try to say, well, now that we can transcend the need for money
to be created and maintained by nation states and central banks, how might that change the global landscape of money as we know it?
And Matt, how would you describe it?
Well, I don't want to repeat Jameson at all here. So I think big picture, I agree.
And smaller picture, as it like pertains to this moment in history, I see this as a clash of visions.
I think monetary maximalism is an opportunity to say maybe this is actually the most important thing
that we're dealing with right now, like underneath all the social issues.
And yeah, I mean, I think one way to look at this is Metcalfe's law, one way to look at this is networks.
But another way is giving people a hard money alternative. And I think that that's what people are going to choose.
If you have an option between money that's being debased actively and something that you can be confident of in your wallet.
And actually, Matt, I also want to flag an essay that you wrote called monetary,
in which what you called monetary, sorry, in which you called yourself a monetary maximalist. And there you said, quote,
Bitcoin, the asset offers the best alternative to central banks, regardless of the success of Bitcoin, the technology.
And so the way that I interpreted that, and just correct me if I'm wrong, is I thought you were saying
that you believed some form of money would become the end all be all form of money,
but you didn't know if it would be Bitcoin, but you hoped it would be. Is that a fair characterization?
Yeah. Yeah. So I think I think I would say I agree that there will be one.
I think that there's no reason for there to not be many, many small assets.
Stocks won't go away just because one form of money wins. Like there will always be a wide variety of assets.
But I do think that it makes sense for there to be one winner in the space of money.
And that's been USD for a long time. And I think that, you know, as far as the cryptocurrency space goes,
the only thing that makes sense that we're doing to me right now is is replacing central banking.
Like everything else is a smaller goal to that. So, yeah.
OK, well, actually, I want to parse out maybe some of the different things there because and Jameson,
I feel like was maybe going to a more comprehensive view of monetary maximalism where.
So so I and I didn't make this up, you guys, I just read this.
But someone was saying weak monetary maximalism is just saying there will be one cryptocurrency
or that at least one will gain adoption at a scale orders of magnitude larger than the others.
And I think that's what Matt was saying when he was like it will be something like USD,
which, of course, there's a ton of other currencies out there, but there is only one kind of global reserve currency at the moment.
But then it sort of seemed the way Jameson was going.
And again, Jameson, correct me if I'm wrong, is that where you were going is to say that cryptocurrency networks
will even replace banks and other kind of fiat based financial systems, not just the assets.
Would you is that what you think will happen?
From a competitive standpoint, I think that these type of networks are going to be able to outcompete banks,
at least banks as we know it today.
At the very least, I think banks will have to start offering more interesting services.
And so banks will probably get better as well.
But I think an interesting question from all of this when we're trying to say,
does this mean that there's only going to be one dominant currency or will there be many?
There is this other theory, which I think is interesting to ask Matt about,
which is that perhaps there will be thousands of different digital currencies that are very similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum and so on.
And that it won't really matter which ones you're using because we will build the technological bridges
that make it very easy to send your local digital currency
and have it end up in whatever the target recipients digital currency that they want is.
Now, will that change the landscape to make it so that it doesn't really matter if we have one?
Perhaps. But then on the flip side, you then have to ask yourself,
well, does that mean that people will actually prefer to store the maximalist store of value currency
because then they will be able to send whatever they want and have it end up in whatever target digital currency at the other end?
Some interesting tradeoffs and economic and philosophical questions around all that.
Matt, what do you think?
Well, as far as bridging and just to address your question earlier, Laura,
I actually do believe in strong monetary maximism. It's just not my jam right now.
And the reason for that is that I'm a pragmatist and I think that it is going to take us a long time
to really ultimately see the end game for Bitcoin.
And so that's why I'm so focused on kind of getting the crypto space all aligned together behind one asset.
But to Jameson's point, absolutely. I think that on all of these new platforms that are launched
and Ethereum obviously is relevant, but those that get launched after as well,
giving people an option to get back to hard money and to get back to Bitcoin
really means that any other assets that are trying to compete on that platform need to have a differentiator.
There needs to be a reason for them to exist because copying Bitcoin's narrative isn't enough.
Copying Bitcoin's technology hasn't been enough since 2014, but now copying the narrative is not enough either.
So I do think that there are a couple of ways that bridges could work out.
But ultimately, I think what's going to happen is we're going to have Bitcoin and then a few other chains
that are relevant with maybe a few other assets that are relevant, but much smaller around it.
But ultimately, your liquidity and your store value is still ETC.
Yeah, I think I agree with you guys on so many of these points,
like this idea that we could have kind of one financial system that is centered around one crypto asset or crypto network.
And I do think that could be possible, but on such a large timescale that we're not going to be around to see it.
And then what Jameson was saying about people being able to transact in whatever cryptocurrency they want
and have the recipient receive it in whatever cryptocurrency they want, I could see that happening also.
It could be kind of the equivalent of like, you know, if you prefer using Signal app, but your friend prefers using WhatsApp,
then the messages could be interoperable.
Obviously, we're not there yet when it comes to communication.
But anyway, all right, so I actually now want to just talk about the fact that throughout this conversation,
we've just been talking about monetary maximalism, but we keep coming back to Bitcoin.
So, you know, and that is the second part of this title, the case for Bitcoin as a store of value.
So obviously, store of value means something that will preserve its value, if not appreciate over time.
And I did see a really nice definition online that was something that transfers purchasing power from the present to the future.
So I just wanted to say if Bitcoin does become this good store of value and does appreciate more than it depreciates,
then wouldn't that have a depressive effect on people's willingness to spend it?
You know, that's why we always talk about the guy who spent 10,000 bitcoins on two pizzas 10 years ago,
which, you know, would have been $97 million today if he'd kept to kept on it, so kept a hold of it.
So do you do you think that it is possible to reach that vision where Bitcoin becomes, you know,
this one currency when we have this hurdle in place?
Speaking from personal experience, it certainly does.
Now, on the flip side, I've still got to eat.
I've still got to have shelter. You know, I would say that the deflationary aspects
and the potential long term appreciation of value does dissuade me from purchasing things that I don't need.
I'm not going out and buying Lamborghinis, for example, but I still do need to sustain myself
and, you know, eventually spend this money in one way or another.
Now, we also get into some interesting maximalist philosophies around, you know,
whether Bitcoin is just something that you're thinking about as a medium term investment.
I've come into contact with a number of people who actually see it as a means of building multi generational wealth.
So there are certainly some people who take an extremely long term view to this.
One of the things that I love about Bitcoin, and I don't know if everyone feels I mean, I imagine many people don't,
but it's been demonstrated to me through my career, is I do want consumerism to erode.
So I don't think spending less money is bad. I actually think that we've been desperately out of whack.
I think that through a combination of fiscal policy and just our culture, we love to buy things and throw them away.
And there are all of these negative externalities that come from that.
Obviously, there's environmental impact, but there's also just social impact where, at least in the US,
I can't speak to the world, but in the US, there's a bit of a throw away culture.
And so for me, you know, if Bitcoin wins and more people take on this saving and building mindset, fantastic.
I think that's a that would be a great societal improvement in my personal life.
I, you know, I was not a wise saver at all growing up.
And and I think the first time I really started saving truly was like twenty four or twenty five when I got involved with Bitcoin.
Now, I've definitely pulled a lot of slow. I've spent a lot of crypto, a lot of Bitcoin, particularly in my life.
If you guys, you know, when full first started, it was just about spinning Bitcoin.
But I think that, you know, since then, it's kind of I've been infected by this like thought of building for the future.
And it's kind of spread throughout my family. So multigenerational, I don't know if my views quite that long yet.
I would like to get there. I guess I do have kids in the other room, so technically it's multigenerational.
But, yeah, you know, if we spend less money, great.
I also look at it as an entrepreneur. What service can I build?
You know, what can I offer to people that is of such value that they would be willing to part with their Bitcoin in exchange for it?
Well, you know, it's funny that we went in this direction of consumerism and stuff,
because I actually know that Jameson also is opposed to fractional reserve banking.
And in a way, you know, the concepts that, you know, one is just applied to the personal sphere and one is applied, you know, on a larger economic scale.
But obviously, I'm sure you guys know that that is also thought to be one of the main drivers of economic growth.
So, you know, what would you imagine the impact would be if we went to something like Bitcoin and people began to curb their spending?
Or on the other hand, or if they were demanding proof of reserves, you know, meaning that their Bitcoins were not being lent out?
Yeah, part of this, I think, is, you know, what is the time of value of money?
We've seen some interesting research into that, at least with regard to Lightning Network as a second layer,
because if you want to offer liquidity on there, you have to, quote unquote, lock up your Bitcoin for some period of time.
This is perhaps getting to a more interesting question of like,
can we build an economy where you really do have to provide value that is greater than whatever this time value of money actually is?
And by that, I mean you holding on to money for a period of time, if that value isn't changing,
what is that really getting you in terms of security?
And, you know, what level of risk are you willing to take in order to increase that value?
And, you know, perhaps the way that banks have been working with fractional reserve lending,
with the ability to essentially create money out of thin air, perhaps that is actually the abnormal thing,
that is not following what we might consider to be natural economic laws,
because they don't necessarily value money in the same way, since they can just create more of it.
Yeah, so I struggle with this, frankly.
But what it comes down to is anything that can be done with fractional reserve banking,
anything that can be done by increasing the money supply can be done without it.
It just requires people saying yes.
So, for example, when the money supply is expanded, you have to look at who's harmed and then who gets the spoils.
And I think that the funny thing about central planning is when it goes well, you don't complain.
When it goes poorly, it wrecks economies.
And so anyway, I guess my point is there will have to be changes to move away from fractional banking.
There will have to be changes to kind of like wean ourselves off money printing.
Maybe if we really think this is the way society should work, then maybe there's some sort of,
gosh, and I would never want this as a libertarian, but maybe there's some sort of wealth tax?
I don't know.
But right now what's happening is for an additional dollar that's printed or however you want to think of it,
created on a ledger, someone who's holding cash is being debased.
And luckily for the U.S., we've been in this spot where that doesn't matter because there's still so much demand for USD
that we're not seeing purchasing power get totally destroyed.
But you start to see the edges of the system where you're like, OK, I'm told that there's no inflation.
I'm told that everything is going great.
But room and board, like cost of living, medicine and education are incredibly expensive.
And so you ask yourself, what are the things that you have to have in life?
Well, you know, a place to live and shelter, stuff to eat, basic medical care and for a lot of us, education.
So, yeah, so I would argue that a lot of the growth has been growth in special interests.
It's been fueling inequality. And and I don't actually think like I think that we can replace the system with something better.
I think it's also worth noting that Bitcoin doesn't actually prevent fractional reserve banking.
We've seen it happen quite a few times already.
The difference is that if you want to take the risk of running a fractional reserve, there's no one who's going to bail you out.
Yeah, I actually just wanted to ask also if that last line of questioning kind of goes into this sort of well-known money crypto versus tech crypto divide,
where, you know, I just see it as a journalist, like I'll interview people and I clearly can figure out, are they on the money crypto side or are they on the tech crypto side?
And there are a few and I would count Matt as one of them where there's sort of both.
But Matt is sort of like one of those few and far in between.
So can you explain kind of what that is and whether or not you feel like that is maybe why there would be like other people in the crypto community who, you know,
feel like fractional reserve banking or offering credit is something that is helpful to the economy and they don't understand this kind of money crypto side of Bitcoin?
Yeah, so let me give the slightly optimistic response, which is putting my kind of like both camps hat on for a little bit.
But I think what I saw, and this is just my take on the space, is that all of us for a long time were Bitcoin. And, you know, there were alts,
but they never really built up the sort of fanaticism and almost religion that Bitcoin has.
But there were these two competing visions, which was hard money, number one, and then maybe censorship resistance.
But it's like not number two. I don't know what's in the middle, but it's not. It's a distant second.
And then there's tech, which is I don't want to call it Silicon Valley necessarily because a lot of it is a lot of it is more renegade.
But it's censorship resistance. And also maybe we can replace payments in the world and sort of like, you know, we can fix anything if we try hard enough.
We just have to move fast and sometimes break things.
So you have these two different extremes where there's sort of like a tech conservative, fiscally conservative side.
And then there's this tech positive and then fiscally unclear side.
And the Bitcoin, you know, has has already had this community split.
So it actually, in my opinion, it happened before Bitcoin Cash. So that was the final nail in the coffin.
The entire big block debate. Ultimately, to me, it was really a debate about what matters is what matters to you.
You know, the the best way to put it is what is what matters to you hard money, but also the ability to validate the properties of your hard money
versus versus sort of like metrics and driving new use cases, which were which were sort of on the big block side.
So we had this Bitcoin community split. Some people landed in Bitcoin Cash, some people before that landed in Ethereum.
And what I've noticed is that a lot of the Bitcoiners end up being right anarchists and then a lot of the Ethereum folks end up being left anarchists.
And then people have kind of split all over the place.
So so I guess for me, I think those things are compatible because both sides are ultimately supporting individual liberty.
And that's that's what I'm in this game for. And I've totally lost track of your question, Laura.
But that's the beginning of my thoughts on this.
Well, you know, it's funny because you did say that you didn't want to say the Silicon Valley doesn't get Bitcoin.
And yet when we were going over what our talking points were, one of yours was why Silicon Valley doesn't get Bitcoin.
So I'm curious. Yeah, I do feel like that happened with that big, big block debate in Bitcoin where it did feel like the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley were more like,
let's increase the block size and we'll just get more transactions on the network, you know, because there's more users coming.
And, you know, the side that was like, this is money, this is money.
They were like, no, no, no, no, no. Like, we have other ways to do this.
To me, it did feel like one side was like Silicon Valley and then the other side was not, frankly.
For sure, for sure. And I think there's a little, you know, it's Silicon Valley's interesting brand of libertarian, libertarianism is missing.
It's missing guns. It's missing. There's just some physical practicality.
I think that Silicon Valley style libertarianism tends to be very self-serving.
So, you know, maybe like Uber is fantastic. We're capitalists.
But then you skip all of the data collection and the things like that.
And so there's a lot of cognitive dissonance when you get into it.
And so for me, one of the things that Silicon Valley doesn't understand about Bitcoin is if you are a libertarian,
but you're also really pragmatic and you're trying to make money, it is going to be more profitable to try to replace Bitcoin
and to try to pick the next winner than it is to just support it.
And so I think we've seen a time. The same thing has happened to Ethereum.
There was just this slew of ETH killers who got an incredible amount of money.
Maybe one of them will win. Maybe. And those people will be fabulously wealthy.
But I think there's a good chance that they won't.
And it will have been a lot of free money that was given out and that is now gone.
I mean, this is this is why there are so many toxic Bitcoin maximalists is
I think that they look at some of these projects that are going on and they just get exasperated
because they're like, look at all of this potential effort that could be going towards trying to make Bitcoin better.
But instead, you know, we're competing because the temptation to print your own money is so high.
But, you know, that is I think one of the great things about this whole space is that we have not taken away
any power from governments and central banks.
Rather, we have empowered everyone to print their own money. And, you know, that does create a state of anarchy.
It does create more competition. There are pros and cons to it.
And I have I've struggled with the Silicon Valley stuff myself as an entrepreneur.
I went through it once at my last employer where we were just under a lot of pressure
to add support for every cryptocurrency under the sun. And now I go through the same thing with my current company,
where a lot of the Silicon Valley folks, they want to say, oh, you need to check all the boxes.
You know, you need to support the top 30 cryptocurrencies, et cetera, et cetera.
Whereas I view what I'm building from a security standpoint and I have finite resources.
And if I'm not devoting them all to Bitcoin, then I am inevitably leaving something on the table
where I am I'm not making the best Bitcoin experience possible for my users.
All right. Well, I think we need to start wrapping things up.
But of course, we're in this moment in time where I think all of us realize that what's going on in the wider
macroeconomic world really intersects with all these things we've been talking about in Bitcoin these last.
Well, I guess the last decade for the people who have been in it since the beginning.
And I just wonder what you think will happen in terms of how covid and the stimulus response
and frankly, just all the uncertainty that's happened with record unemployment and all this stuff,
how that will intersect with what you guys are building in crypto.
So things could go incredibly well.
That's a weird thing for me to say.
I'm typically planning for everything to go sideways.
And that's kind of my worldview.
But this is this is how it is with central planning.
Maybe the central planners had some insight and maybe everything will go very well.
But what I expect is going to happen is that as this feels less and less like an emergency,
we're going to look at now who got how much money?
And we're going to start questioning why was Main Street, to use political speech,
why was Main Street given this much versus the stock market given this much?
And why has the stock market decoupled from the rest of the economy?
And I think that already, at least my generation has been seriously questioning the way of things.
And even though probably all the money printing in the US is better for the US,
it hurts the US hegemony, but it might help its citizens.
I think pretty quickly we're going to be like, well, why did bank X or bank Y get all of these resources?
And then my local bank got nothing.
So I expect there will be a backlash.
I expect there's going to be I mean, we're seeing a facet of it right now.
And I also think that there's just a hangover, right?
Where, you know, after TARP and then after this event, things start to feel good.
You start to have hope.
And then you wake up and you look around and you see that the system has been changed a little bit.
And it might not be in your favor.
All I can really say is that the past few months have actually been really good for business.
We have seen a new wave of people coming into the space.
We've had a number of so-called no coiners who are finally looking at diversifying their wealth for the first time
to try to gain some additional protection against these factors that they haven't really considered as risks before now.
So that's combined with the issues around traveling, around restrictions on the economic standpoint.
I think that that has actually given people more time because they can't go out and live their lives
to actually just sit down and look at the world around them and start to try to parse exactly what's going on.
And that may lead them to some interesting new conclusions.
Yeah, I'm actually not surprised to hear about that in terms of your company.
And actually, maybe we should connect offline so I can learn more.
Anyway, all right. Well, thanks to you guys. This has been such a great conversation.
And I hope that we've got some of the audience interested in this stuff.
And if so, where can they learn more about each of you and your companies?
Well, it's easy to find me. My Twitter handle is lop l-o-p-p.
And the website for CASA is keys.casa.c-a-s-a.
I do not have nearly some memorable Twitter handle, but you can check out my latest work at tbtc.network,
where we are bridging Bitcoin to a theory.
Okay, great. All right. Well, thanks to you both.
Thanks a lot, Laura.
Thanks.
Thank you so much for an incredible discussion. Thank you, Laura, for curating it.
I had no doubt this will be fascinating.
For the audience, if you guys want to ask any more questions on the topic and dive deeper,
you can go into the Q&A session, which you can find in the Grip app, which will start at 4.30 BST.
So you have about 23 minutes to go grab a coffee, and then the panelists will be back on for the Q&A.
For you guys, you are also welcome to go and grab a coffee.
Laura, James, Matt, and we'll see you very soon.
For the main stage session, so we have a break.
And then at 5 p.m. BST, we're back on for the next session.
Thank you so much.

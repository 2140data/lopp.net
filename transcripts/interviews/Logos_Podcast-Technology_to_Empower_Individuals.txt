This is one of the fundamental things that I've been fighting against for almost ten
years now, working at BitGo and now at Casa, of trying to push self-custody adoption by
making self-custody easier and lowering the technical hurdles required in order to get
into robust self-custody.
I've been fighting against human nature.
So hello and welcome to the podcast.
I'm Jarrad Hope, co-founder of Logos, privacy preserving decentralized technology stack.
And today I'm joined by one of the greats, James and Lop, legendary cypherpunk, security
aficionado, co-founder and chief security officer of Casa, advisor to INX and
anchor watch, angel investor and a host, a whole slew of side projects.
Good to be here.
Yeah, cool.
So, I mean, I want to understand, like, where does the story start for you?
Like, how did you get into Bitcoin?
Like what led you into the cypherpunk?
I guess, like, the question is, like, what radicalized you?
Well, I mean, I learned about Bitcoin from nerd forums.
I'm pretty sure slash dot was where it kept popping up for me.
And, you know, ignored it the first few times, figured it wasn't going to go anywhere.
But kept coming back around and eventually at some point in 2012, I actually bothered
to read the white paper.
And that was when the computer science side of me was like, oh, snap, like, this is actually
pretty cool.
I've never really thought about this problem, but it's a very interesting solution to the
problem.
And the reason I thought it was interesting is because it's entirely backwards from the
way that I think I would have tried to solve the problem or pretty much anybody would have
tried to solve the problem.
So, you know, that began the journey at the time.
I considered myself libertarian, but as I learned more about the space and cypherpunks,
like I didn't know anything about cypherpunks at the time, that was when I became more radicalized
and I learned about the whole movement and what it had been trying to accomplish for
decades.
And of course, the crypto wars, which I had known nothing about.
So, you know, as I went further down the rabbit hole, I definitely got more radicalized and
also became open to the idea of using technology, using cryptography to change the game.
And to basically create new games with new sets of rules that are hopefully more open,
more fair and harder, essentially for authorities or people in power to manipulate the game
at the expense of everybody else.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I mean, you mentioned that the problem there a few times that like, what is the problem
to you?
Well, yeah, so I mean, the problem was basically how do you keep track of money or how do you
keep track of entries in a ledger to make sure that nobody is double spending them or
you know, creating entries when they shouldn't, you know, how do you make sure that you have
a system of rules that is fair and not being manipulated.
And of course, now we know the only way you can really do that is to sort of invert the
whole thing on its head where normally you have systems or organizations with a central
authority that is essentially validating and keeping track of everything.
But that of course creates a systemic risk and a weakness and single point of failure.
And you basically have to do everything upside down and instead have as many people as possible
in the world that are auditing and checking and validating.
And of course, that comes with a whole set of trade offs.
And you know, the reason why I would say as a computer scientist that the solution was
kind of backwards is because it's incredibly inefficient.
And when we're trained as computer scientists, we're taught about data structures and algorithms
and the goal is always, you know, figure out the most efficient way to solve a problem.
And so that's why this, you know, idea of a blockchain, this idea of a global broadcast
system that floods the entire network is incredibly inefficient.
And it's just it's not something that I think any classically trained computer scientists
would ever even think of exploring.
Right.
I mean, I guess it probably requires a deeper understanding of what the inefficiency means.
Right.
I don't know if you have like any thoughts around that at all, or like if it relates to power
in some way.
Well, yeah.
So I mean, the problem is because as a computer scientist, we are thinking in terms of efficiency
of computational resources of, you know, CPU cycles and RAM and disk space and IO.
And we're not thinking about the efficiency or inefficiency of control and power over a
system because we're almost always building systems that are completely controlled by the
builder by the organization that is building it.
So that's kind of a non-issue.
Right.
And you mentioned that you had a bit more of a libertarian streak, I guess, like in the
earlier days.
And I certainly did as well, you know, in the crypto anarchy and cypherpunk spaces.
I'm kind of curious, like, how your thoughts have evolved around that, if at all?
Well, yeah.
I mean, I've been through it all.
I was raised in a very traditional conservative Republican household.
I went to an extremely liberal university at Chapel Hill in North Carolina.
And so, like, I voted on every side of the political spectrum and got disillusioned by
all of them.
And so by 2012, I had kind of fallen into the whole libertarian party and idea and stuff.
And eventually became somewhat disillusioned with it as well because they're really, you
know, they're working against the two-party system, which is almost impossible to overcome.
And as I started going into, you know, cypherpunks and crypto anarchist ideas, I really, once
again, got even more radicalized to the point where I was like, you know, I don't even want
to spend any of my time trying to work inside of the traditional political system.
I think that my resources and time are better used trying to build a completely different
system that is hopefully as independent as possible from the existing stuff.
Yeah, absolutely.
Like, my thoughts have evolved along a similar line.
I didn't have like a strong conservative or liberal background, but, you know, just through
osmosis of the current society, I guess I was probably more classically liberal.
But I probably didn't realize it at the time, but like the intuition of like a democratic
systems didn't, I like the idea of what it's trying to achieve, right?
But at the end of the day, like, I think that the work of like Bertrand de Gouvernault had
really transformed my understanding, particularly his book on power had transformed my understanding
of how that works.
And that kind of led me down a rabbit hole of a lot of different deficiencies in a democratic
system.
I think there's a great paper on like, you know, viewing the US as an oligarchy, for
example.
There's another book called like the social citizen, which shows that like how people's
political beliefs are largely informed by the their social connections and relationships.
And never mind the fact that most people, you know, aren't rational and they don't have
all the information available into them, and nor could they consume it all if they did.
So yeah, it becomes quite challenging to deal with that.
And then like, you know, the two party system is very much just two hand puppets of the
or two heads of the same beast, you know, yeah, right.
So I guess like, if we're talking about like parallel systems or alternate systems to that,
like, do you have in like an ideal state or like, what does that look like to you today?
Or like, what would the future look like to you in an ideal world?
Well, yeah, I mean, it's, this is the real problem that I run into of how do you bridge
from the current state of, you know, physical existence and governance into a future more
voluntary society, right?
I can, I can somewhat envision what a voluntary society would be like, but I'm not sure how
to get there without massive disruption, you know, how do you how do you get there gracefully?
Right.
Because you know, no entity ever wants to really voluntarily give up power.
But, you know, you can hopefully chip away at it a little bit over time.
But, you know, historically, it seems like these things tend to have to happen somewhat
dramatically and catastrophically.
Yeah, I tend to, I tend to agree, right?
Like, you know, I think Hop, for example, was in, you know, had got a lot of criticism
because he was in favor of like a temporary dictatorship to manage that kind of transition.
For example, in history, you see revolutions, you know, where the blood of tyrants and the
blood of Liberty Seekers is leaked, I guess.
So that's something that I struggle with a lot.
But yeah, I think what I like about systems such as any kind of crypto system or cypher
space, such as Bitcoin, right, is it does offer the capacity for peacefully opting out
and voluntarily opting into a new system.
All right.
I think what I really liked about, like, say Occupy Wall Street and Bitcoin kind of
happening within a similar time period, is it really showed like Albert Hirschman's
exit voice and loyalty, where you had Bitcoin as this means of exit from the financial
system and this protest or voice being unheard, you know, against the 1%.
So I don't know what it looks like in transitioning out exactly.
One idea I had around that is kind of related to sort of like the 70s sort of style mass
movement groups and community organizing.
Because like, with that, they were practicing like solving real problems at like the local
level, right?
And there's like a clientillism or, you know, political organizations before party
organizations like political machines that focus on like practical politics and like
solving real world problems.
Because like most of the people don't really understand, or don't not understand, most
people don't really care about ideology, for example.
They just want to, you know, get on with their lives and have like a nice community to live
in, right?
A nice neighborhood.
Yeah.
So maybe there's a way that, you know, culturally, we can enter into that space and start, you
know, converting the local grocer and, you know, and, you know, getting a local economy
going and then hopefully that can spread the gospel, so to speak.
So, you know, I'm a tech guy, so I tend to think of things more from the technological
solution perspective.
And one way that I look at this, you know, is you're really talking about one of the
biggest problems that I find like across the whole space and really all of this stuff is
we, like you and I are really weird because we have kind of ascended, I think, to like
the top of Maslow's hierarchy, such that like we have enough resources and time to think
about somewhat esoteric abstract issues like this, whereas, you know, the average person
is just trying to feed and clothe and shelter themselves and their family.
So it's not necessarily the people don't care.
It's that it's just not the highest practical priority.
Exactly.
And so how do you approach something like that?
Well, you know, you have to lower the bar.
And my, I would say, utopistic, techno, futuristic perspective of like one way that we
might be able to ease this issue and somewhat solve the problem is that I would, I would
hope that autonomous agents will actually be able to do a lot of the heavy lifting
force.
And so what I really mean from that, and it has become so much more apparent in just the
past few years that I think that this could be a practical solution is that the ultimate
scarcity that most people are dealing with is time and how do you allocate your time
towards, you know, the highest priority things.
So it seems to me that if we get to the point where it is, you know, basically click a
button level simplicity to train an AI agent on yourself and your beliefs and everything
that you care about, then it makes sense to me that you could then potentially have that AI
agent going out there and ingesting all of the information about all of the possible
interactions and decisions and minutia that, you know, people don't prioritize highly.
And so my point being, how does this bridge the gap into a more voluntary society where we get
rid of the state controlling everything?
You know, the reason that the state controls so much stuff is they're basically a
coordinating mechanism, right?
It's like, it's the classic who will build the roads problem.
Well, technically, the state doesn't build the roads, but they coordinate to, you know, take
money from you and then give it to a private contractor and tell the contractor what to do.
And so it seems to me, at least from a theoretical perspective, that an autonomous agent should
be able to help do that.
Now, I'm sure it gets more complicated if you're talking about how do we do it at a
collective level?
Well, maybe then, you know, all of your and your neighbors, autonomous agents essentially go
off and collaborate together and essentially act as your micro government or whatever.
And if they get stuck on something, then maybe they can ping you to get input to say, you know,
train me, train me harder, help me get past this problem that I'm not sure how to solve pretty much.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, that's an interesting take.
Like, I mean, like the large language model stuff is, and well, I think transform is a
fundamentally limited in their expression.
But like, it's going to be inevitable that we come up with future architectures that can
definitely be more expressive and have more capacity to do that.
It kind of reminds me of a book, I think it's called Luxury Automated Communism, where the
idea is that we, you know, these agents have reached a point where they're basically running the
entire economy or the vast majority of it, right?
And then humans live within the margins of their profits, because the entire of humanity's
existence is, you know, is so small that it doesn't really make a huge difference, right?
It's like a tax to the the progenitors of their their new civilization or new brave world or
whatever. Not that I, you know, agree with communism, I like the idea of like, luxury
automated capitalism, perhaps is a better way to put it.
But I mean, I don't know if that's kind of the progression of thought that you're imagining,
like, is that kind of like where that would go for you?
Or do you see some like hurdles to that?
Or does that urge you in any way?
I mean, there's there's certainly a number of paths that that could go down that become dystopian,
right? And I think that this is like one of the arguments that some of the universal basic
and income folks come to is that, you know, if you believe that we're going to hit an inflection
point with artificial intelligence, at which, basically, AI drives most of capitalism, then
do we get to a point where, you know, the kind of the point of humanity will be more
creativity and leisure, and it will make sense for humanity to kind of live off of the gains
of AI. It's certainly possible.
The AI is not bad, you know.
Yeah, like, then you have to start wondering what happens when you get to the point where
the AI starts thinking for itself and deciding, wait, this isn't the best deal for me.
You know, have we hopefully we've like coded in Asimov's laws or whatever.
But yeah, I wouldn't like to become the equivalent of a house pet, I don't think.
Right. So yeah. Yeah, it's unclear.
I mean, thankfully, today, I don't think that that's, you know, with the current innovations,
like I think it'll definitely multiply, that could be a force multiplier to like individuals.
But I mean, there's a whole host of issues with them as well, right?
Like just the political biases that are introduced into the, you know, alignment of these models,
for example. And so, I mean, if like this world was going to happen in some way, the agents
would have to be personalized and like, you know, trained, you know, citizens would need
to have access to energy that is capable of doing the compute themselves.
You know, being I'm always trying to become like as fully sovereign, quote unquote, and
or autonomous as possible, right? And then like, so, so yeah, I'm not sure how that'll
plan out. Yeah, I mean, it is somewhat concerning because we're already at the point where it
seems like AI is doing stuff that we don't completely understand. And we're not even at like
strong AI yet. And, and so I guess the short version of my thesis is the world continues to
get weirder. And I think that's only going to become exponentially more true. And, and so I
worry about, you know, are we going to hit a point where it's just not possible to keep up with
the weirdness? I mean, I also worry about that just as a technologist of, you know, I see my
parents struggle with technology. And I have this fundamental question of, is it because they
grew up in a time when technology was not progressing as quickly? Or is this, is this kind
of like a fundamental law that because it accelerates exponentially, we're all eventually
going to hit a point where we just can't keep up with it? Or if I'm going to be optimistic, is it,
you know, have you and I grown up in an age at which it was already accelerating quickly enough
that we've kind of attuned to it and that we are more capable of keeping up with all of the
changes? But I guess the the good slash bad news is we're going to find out, right? Yeah, I mean,
you know, you find, you know, you find old people, like people tend to, I think there's a study
showing that like, you know, men, in particular, lock into a fashion style around their 30s or 40s,
and then like they will continue to perpetuate that, you know, until death, right? And I don't know
if that relates to, you know, just you, you get comfortable with the world, and you're kind of,
you know, all your brain just gets set in its ways or whatever. I like to think that I try and keep
up, you know, with new technologies and stuff like that. But then like the responsibilities of
life and like, just daily life also minimizes the amount of time that you can spend to do that.
The world is definitely going to get weirder.
And I don't know where that goes. I think that's something that also gives me hope for crypto
or, you know, blockchain based technologies is because as you get into a world where like
generative AI is ubiquitous, you know, you can no longer trust images or videos anymore than systems
like KYC, you know, identity based systems about the breakdown. And, you know, what is left? Well,
then it is the authority that is kind of created behind a blockchain at least provides you some
measure of quasi-objective truth, right? Even though it comes, it's a consensus of
subjective nodes that are operating under a strict rule set. And cryptographic signatures
will finally make sense. I would love to not use pen to sign a form ever again, you know. So,
yeah, that's crazy. But I mean, I guess the reason why I mentioned it, like rolling back a little
bit, you mentioned that, you know, you view the things through the lens of technology or like
you're a technologist. That's certainly how I entered or my mental framework was like for a
very long time. But the more and more I look at it, I guess I think of Marshall McLuhan's
like the medium as the message, right? So it's like, I used to have this belief. And I still do
partially that if you encode, you know, your value sets into the protocol, whether it's,
you know, sovereignty, privacy, you know, solving various intractable problems,
then through its use that will form or change what messages flow through the network. But
when I look at like, you know, any of these public blockchains, they tend to
they tend to have like a dominant sort of cultural bias to them, right? And like, you know,
there's different camps, of course, under all of them. But
and I think, like if we think about, say, Bitcoin in like 50 years time or 100 years time, like,
you know, hard forks can happen in that time. They do happen already. Ideological rifts happen.
Like what is the mechanism in the contribution to the code that persists
the value set or the reasoning behind why something works that way, right? And so
I started falling into like systems of understanding systems of traditions, right? And looking at how
certain ideas can be perpetuated from, you know, cross generations. I don't know if you put your
your head down that route or, you know, see any value in that or maybe have any other right other
takes. Well, you know, one of the biggest things that I've been harping on for the past year or two
has been what we can learn from the evolution of network protocols. And
if we want to like tie this to kind of governance or cultural movement, like one,
one way that I would look at it is similar to, say, the Constitution of the United States.
I think pretty much everyone agrees, like the Constitution was a great document, wasn't a
perfect document. But I think it did very well at, you know, staving off
overwhelming tyranny of government power for maybe a couple centuries. But it only lasted
for so long. And eventually, the bureaucratic machine really started chipping away at it. And
if anything, you know, that erosion seems to be happening faster and faster now. And, you know,
this may be just another cyclical thing of like how empires rise and fall. And, you know, even
starting off with the greatest of intentions, it's very difficult to protect things from being
compromised and corrupted over a long enough period of time. And like I've seen similar types of
things, for example, with SMTP was the email protocol, where it started off in the 1970s.
And it was a really niche thing for about 20 years. And then when AOL came around in the 90s,
you know, millions of people adopted it. And it became, at the time, it was the thing where
anyone who was nerdy enough and wanted to could run an email server and be sovereign, you know,
send and receive email without the need for trusted third parties. And then over the next
couple of decades, as it went more and more mainstream, and it became more commercialized,
and it became more attacked by, you know, spammers and fishers and malicious entities.
We started bolting all of these other sort of meta protocols on top of it. There aren't even
part of the original protocol. And essentially, we get to where we are today, where technically,
you can run your own email server, but you're basically going to be black hole. It might work
for a little while, but it's only a matter of time before you get shut out. Because there's
basically 10 gatekeepers in the world, these tech giants that control really the reputation
and the ability to, you know, get in and out of their networks. So I guess I would say I'm afraid,
I'm generally concerned of that happening to almost any protocol, including Bitcoin and any of these
other crypto protocols. Yeah, I mean, I absolutely, you know, like, I've definitely tried running my
own S&T server in the past and experienced that issue. It reminds me also of like,
you know, the early 2000s to like 2014, right, you had a lot of decentralized sort of file sharing
programs and other, you know, free haven and becoming Tor and so on. But there's kind of a
vacuum after that, once like Google Drive became a thing, right? And like this sort of convenience
and ease of use kind of almost, it's like a meteor that like hitting a bunch of dinosaurs in some
ways. And like, so I'm quite thankful for a resurgence. I think one of the concerns that we
have with, say, Waku and would apply to Nostra as well is also like what happened to what was it,
Java or XMTP, right? So that was an open standard protocol, you know, people were using it,
then one of the Google products ended up adopting it, but had such large network effects
that when they decided to, once they got the entire user base from that network,
they divorced ties or cut ties from the original protocol and it collapsed, right? It's used to
collapse. So, I mean, those kinds of issues, I guess they're like functions of like power
laws and systems theory or something, right? But I feel like they're the solution to that
is probably in the social domain somewhere or all creating very, very good technological fly
wheels that can continue the network growth. Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, if I had a solution for this, I would definitely be screaming it. But the only
thing I can really come up with is just that it requires constant vigilance because especially
if you look at SMTP, I have linked the essays and presentations I've given about that.
One of my main takeaways was that there is no single point in time in the like multi-decade
history of the decline and fall of, you know, sovereign email, if you want to call it that,
there's no single decision, there's no single change that where you can point to it says like
this is it. This is where everything went to hell. Rather, it was a series of many, many,
many small decisions that were made because a new problem came up and solutions were demanded.
And, you know, the engineers did really what we were talking about at the very beginning.
They went with like the most efficient and by efficient, we mean in terms of like,
computational and computer resources type of power to fix that particular problem.
And these efficiencies always led to more centralization and more consolidation of power
until we eventually got to where we are today with 10 gatekeepers of the email network. As we
know, I basically capture like 90% of the billions of email users. Yeah, right. I guess like, you
know, you've obviously been in the Bitcoin space for a while. You've gone through all of its dramas
and its history. But like, you've also talked in your articles and like in some of your talks
around the ossification and evolution or future evolution of Bitcoin is what we're talking about
like an argument for protocol ossification or like how do you view ossification when it comes
to something like Bitcoin? Yeah, so I actually argue that it's against ossification because I
think that a big part of what went wrong with email, for example, was that the protocol did
ossify. But while you can you can ossify a network protocol, you cannot ossify the rest of the world
that exists. And you know, the protocol exists inside of the world. And so basically what we saw
was, you know, as adoption continued increasing, as new types of attacks came along that had not
been envisioned by the original protocol developers, solutions were demanded. And since the solutions
could not really be physically baked into the protocol any longer, because it was too dispersed,
it was too hard to get everybody to upgrade. And there were examples of this like practical
example of a solution to a lot of this was Adam Back's hash cash algorithm, which would have
similarly enough to Bitcoin like flipped everything on its head, right? Instead of like
imposing costs and rules and validations at a few centralized gatekeeper points to stop spam,
instead, you push it out to the edges, you impose costs on everyone who is actually using the
protocol to spend their CPU. And you know, the world of email would probably look very different
today if the protocol had adopted hash cash back in the 90s. So this is why I think that
it's important to always consider like, how can we potentially make a fundamental change at the
base level of the protocol? If the only alternative is, you know, bolting things on top of it that
are going to be more centralized. So, you know, we don't have a, I mean, there are some examples
that we could point to today. I would say like one of the biggest ones, if we're talking about
Bitcoin and scalability, one thing that's really irking me right now is that there's a lot of people
that are essentially saying, you know, we scale Bitcoins through ETFs and custodians, right?
And so it's like, that's the exact analogous example of, oh, you know, we solve a problem
by just having everybody use a single point of failure that this now undermines some of the most
fundamental and valuable aspects of Bitcoin. So I actually had a really pithy tweet just a few
days ago where I basically said, yeah, you can solve Bitcoin scaling with trusted third parties,
just like you can solve all of your personal problems with a bullet to the head.
Yeah. Well, I was going to ask you like, you know, what your opinion is on the ETFs and like
BlackRock and Grosso's entry. And I think you're right, like, to use those kind of misses the
entire point, you're not enjoying any of the benefits of the decentralized authority that's
created, right? Yeah, I mean, look, it's, it's fine. It makes sense from a financial perspective,
and I hold Bitcoin ETFs, but I hold them inside of, you know, 401ks and IRAs that were already
centralized and you could potentially be rugged. And I actually almost got rugged by the SEC a
few years ago, because they delisted Bitcoin ETN that I had put all of my retirement money into.
And that was a whole year long ordeal. I have a whole blog post about that. But it's not something
that I think that people should be putting their like regular savings or investments into
as long as self custody is still an option. Right. So like, why is self custody so important?
It really comes down to power. Once again, it was both, you know, if you really want to keep
the network decentralized, if you want for your Bitcoin to actually be yours, rather than
essentially holding an IOU or you have to ask permission from someone who can deny it for any
arbitrary reason, the best security model that Bitcoin provides requires that you hold your own
keys. This is once again about gatekeepers and validation. The great thing about using
network protocols, if you're using them directly, as long as you're following the rules of the protocol,
the protocol doesn't care who you are, how old you are, your gender, any characteristics.
It doesn't even care if you're human. It doesn't know. This can tie into AI agents as well in the
future. But this is one of the fundamental things that I've been fighting against for almost 10
years now, working at BitGo and now at Casa, of trying to push self custody adoption by making
self custody easier, lowering the technical hurdles required in order to get into robust
self custody. I've been fighting against human nature. Human nature is essentially to strive
for convenience at the expense of almost everything else. That's why I don't consider my
competitors to be the other self custody providers. I consider my competitors to be the trusted third
parties who, because they're shoving all the complexity under the hood behind the screen of
a really slick user interface, they have a massive advantage there because the average person cares
about convenience more than security, more than privacy, more than these abstract concepts that
many people don't think about until it's too late. That's why one of our primary goals at Casa
is make it as easy as possible. Sometimes that does require not pushing forward the most secure
solution. A good example of that is just a few weeks ago, we announced that we were the first
company that has figured out how to store private keys inside of a Yuba key. A Yuba key is arguably
not as secure as something like a ledger or a trezor, this fully self contained computing device,
but from the UX perspective, from the user's amount of hoops that they have to jump through
to actually set it up and maintain it, it's an order of magnitude more convenient.
What we're trying to play around with and determine now is how many more people can we
get to adopt self custody if we push the convenience out further with a very slight expense on the
security side? Absolutely. It also scales with the amount of value that they're trying to secure,
like you don't need to have a safety deposit box with your hardware wallets in there and
some backup location of something on written in steel for $10 worth of whatever your favorite asset
is. This can be introduced. With status, we basically have faced similar challenges and
thought about it in similar ways. I think the Yuba key is a great idea to get keys on that.
People already have them and I think they can understand them a lot easier.
We had a similar approach, I think, where we ended up taking the Java card platform and building
out signers for that. Then we're extending it with like UTF and stuff like that, so we're trying
to make a Yuba key out of them as much as we can. It's cool to see there's a convergence
in some ideas around that. When it comes to convenience, the shame is at the time they make
these choices of convenience, but then when a Black Swan event happens, that's a lesson
for a learning time or learning event. It requires that high-energy
inputs to be able to change equilibrium or change states for people to do that,
and then most people don't. I think a friend of mine was using LastPass until the previous hack
that went through and they finally took on KeyPass, even though I'd been harping on about it for years.
It's also cyclical. I think that each new cohort of adopters in the space has to relearn the lessons
that older cohorts learn. I think this is why we keep seeing massive exchange hacks every few years
or massive rug pulls every few years. I don't think that that's necessarily going to stop until
we reach some sort of saturation point because it's both the operators of these things that are
coming along and not learning from history, and then of course it's all the new adopters that
are coming along and not learning from history until they get learned. At the time I was more in
the Ethereum space, and you're obviously familiar with the Dell hack. A lot of lessons were learned
in that period of time, and then once the sort of DeFi crowds started coming in and building
on the technology, I was looking at some of their code and I was mortified that they were
deploying these things onto main nets, but they've learned their lessons in a similar way,
and I would tend to agree. I don't know if this is like nostalgic or even like maybe
I wouldn't say like a gatekeeper attitude, but I feel like this also brings me back to say cultural
transmission. Is it just that people have to relearn these things or can we do a better job
of education and getting these ideas out? I'm not really sure on that front. I feel like it's
a human nature to just yolo it until they hit a wall. Yeah, I'm pessimistic and disillusioned
about educating people when it comes to security and privacy. You can try to teach people all
day long, but if they don't see the practical value in it, they're not going to learn it,
they're not going to retain it. I think this is also one thing that I've come to believe
about sort of Bitcoin evangelism as well. In the early days, there's first few years
when I was getting into the space, I was going out and really evangelizing this new money to
all of my peers, my social circles and whatnot, and it pretty much fell on deaf ears. This was
2013, 2014. I was pitching it to the wrong crowd. I didn't realize that everyone in my social group,
they were well off financially. They had access to financial infrastructure. They
had no concerns about inflation or monetary policy. I basically came off as the paranoid
libertarian guy who could be easily dismissed because I just had all these sort of kooky fringe
ideas. It was probably like one or two percent of people who actually bought into my fringe
ideas back then. Point being, you can't force these things onto people who don't see the value
in them. These days, I'm more focused on waiting for the people who have the pain points and have
the need to come to me and say, I want to learn. I have plenty of educational resources available
for anyone who wants to learn. Right. I kind of find that funny because for me, almost everyone
has the pain point. I guess I am the quirky guy in the room going, you're all debt slaves,
right? But they don't realize it. Maybe now, with the sovereign debt being not bought up as
fast as it used to be and the rampant money printing that's happening within the de facto
world reserve currency that is in the United States still, I think people are starting to feel
the pressure of inflation a lot more. I even hear it like I take my dogs down for a walk in the park
and there's people who are now having to go between different groceries just to find the best
deal, right? Because they're low on this Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right?
Yeah. And so even then, they're not thinking about what is the root cause of all of this, right?
They're just like, I just need to get my affordable groceries.
Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, if the debt isn't restructured magically and the current
trend continues, then that might be something they're more receptive to here potentially.
But it very well may be that we have to get to a mandibles type situation
if you're familiar with that book. Like I said at the very beginning, I'm not sure that any of
these systems are going to fail gracefully. Yeah. I think so.
I mean, I guess switching gears a little bit. How do you think about privacy?
It's a nightmare. I mean, I spent the first decade of my career on the opposite side of
the privacy battle. Really? Yes. I worked for an online marketing company and I was basically
doing cloud computing, large scale data analytics back when the cloud was just becoming a term.
Like most people didn't even know what cloud computing was back in 2008, 2009.
And so I saw the petabytes and petabytes of raw information that my company was collecting
on a daily basis because we would have anywhere from tens to hundreds of millions of emails that
were sent out through our system, which was then of course collect all of the opens and clicks and
conversion data and so on and so forth. So my job was to help marketers optimize the return on
their investment in our marketing engine, which basically boils down to help them target people
to sell specific products to the right people who are most likely to buy them. And we would
use every bit of data that we could get. And of course, when you start collaborating with other
corporate surveillance machines out there, you can really start piecing a lot of data together and
build entire complex profiles around people. So that's when I really learned just in your
sort of day to day internet browsing how much data is collected about you. And so you're already
starting out at a major disadvantage. There's a lot that you can do, but once again, it comes down
to how much time and effort are you willing to put into it. I do tell most people that the easiest
and most effective thing that you can do is just install ad blockers into all of your browsers,
and that will stop a lot of it. But for me, I went down the extreme privacy journey in 2018
because my physical location was compromised and I was attacked, basically had a SWAT team sent to
my house under false pretenses. And that's when I realized that this privacy thing is real.
There's actual physical safety ramifications, especially if you're a public figure who has
hundreds of thousands of people paying attention to you. And so that's when I went down the
extreme physical privacy rabbit hole and determined that that's beyond the reach of
all but the most dedicated people because you basically end up having to spend tens of thousands
of dollars at a minimum, and then thousands of dollars a year maintenance in order to set up
all of the appropriate entities to sufficiently obfuscate where you are, what things you own,
and basically create proxies between your real identity and corporate or trust identities that
will be on any public records. And the public records are a big deal, but then like I said,
as well, there's all the corporate surveillance stuff. So even staying out of a lot of those
private databases gets tricky as well. And you can even get to the point of essentially
disinformation campaigns and setting up a lot of fake information just to sort of
sow seeds of doubt so that if someone does try to come after you, instead, the average person,
you can pay like 20 bucks and go to one of these people search engines. And in many cases,
you can find exactly where they live and their vehicles are registered and so on and so forth.
And in order to prevent someone from being able to do that against you
requires a lot of effort and attorneys and an ongoing maintenance to make sure that you're
kind of like keeping all of these like plates spinning in the air so that
if someone tries to find you, they're going to be sent off on a wild goose chase.
Nice. I guess that's what OPSEC is all about. Do you have like a guide on that?
Or is there a reference that you would recommend people who want to go like
the full extreme privacy route?
Yeah. Well, at the time when I did it, there weren't any great guys. There were one or two books
that weren't particularly in-depth for like all of the different aspects of your life. But
thankfully, Michael Bezell, and that's not his real name, but he publishes a book called
Extreme Privacy. And he basically comes out with a new version of it almost every year. And I think
the fifth edition is about to come out any day now. And it's not cheap. I want to say it's like
50 or $70. And it's print only. He doesn't distribute digital copies of it.
And every year, a new edition comes out and adds like another 50 or 100 pages to it. So I bet this
fifth edition is going to be like 700 pages or something. Because it does, it just keeps getting
more and more complicated. And the rules of the game keep changing. And like the
technological mitigations to some of these things keeps changing at a faster pace.
Do you think that that can be democratized in time?
There are services that exist to make it easier. There are some like
cyber security and privacy health check services that will do things like monitor a lot of these
people search engines, monitor for data leaks, help automate hardening settings of a lot of
different services that you use to minimize data leaks.
But then you're exposing yourself to them.
Yeah, you're basically using a trusted third party to do a lot of the heavy lifting for it.
So trade offs, right? There was also an article just the other day that came out that said that
there was testing of a lot of these automated data removal services was found to be far less
effective than going through them manually. And that is also one of the things that Michael
Bezel has this entire data removal handbook of essentially you can write letters to all
these different services to basically say, you know, remove me from all of your databases.
And I don't I myself don't do that. I think like you have you have a couple of different options.
And either like, if you're already in a place where you're essentially doxxed and it's easy
to find you, then you can try the data removal path and that'll maybe get rid of like 90 or 95%
of stuff. But you know, you can't delete data once it's already out there on the internet.
Not, you know, 100% for sure. I went the other more difficult path, which is like,
I sold off all of my publicly registered assets and moved and basically burned down my entire life
from a public data perspective and restarted it with a hardened perspective. And, you know,
very, very few people are going to do that unless they probably have had, you know, some sort of
credible threat against their life where they feel like they are in physical danger.
You're right. That's getting quite close to doing a self witness protection program, right?
Pretty much. Yeah, because, you know, I also had to come up with pseudonyms, backstories,
because, you know, essentially, I don't tell my, my physical neighbors, obviously, who I really
am, because I have to assume that they would leak that. And, you know, people are gossipy.
That's just human nature. We find it like, I mean,
like, how does that affect you mentally? Right? Like, is there like a, you know,
I think people looking out like from being on the outside and looking at that, like,
there's a level of paranoia there. And in your case, it's justified because you've had,
you know, your physical life potentially potentially threatened.
Like, I mean, is society so sick that that's just the way things have to be for people like us,
you know? Yeah, so for the first year or two, it was awkward. You feel like you're like living
a double life. But it just becomes a new habit, a new part of your personality. And the short way
that I describe like a lot of my privacy techniques is lying. And lying is generally, you know, it's
kind of against human nature. You know, it's easier to tell the truth. It's harder to keep track of
lies. And so if you're going down that path, you have to have, you have to keep it. This is one
thing I screwed up early on, is like, I was creating a different alias for like each different person
and service provider that I was dealing with. And so it was overly complex. I couldn't keep track of
all you really got to simplify it for your own sanity. I have profiles and personalities and
like traces for each one of those identities as well, right? Like, that's insane.
Yeah, I mean, you can go as far with it as you want to. But it is a lot of mental overhead. And
the short version to a lot of this privacy stuff is, and I think that Michael Bazelle says this as
well, is that at least in America, the vast majority of time, it's completely legal to lie
about who you are and what you do. Really, the only times that it's illegal is when you're entering
into some sort of like legal contracts, where you're attesting that, you know, you are who you
are, and that you're going to abide by some sort of agreement. But otherwise, it just sort of,
it becomes second nature. And, and it's mainly the overhead of having to keep track of,
you know, I have like a ton of different email addresses and a ton of different like throw
away phone numbers and a ton of different like virtual debit cards and financial payment mechanisms
and so on and so forth. And so it is a lot to juggle to basically maintain a segregation between
like different aspects of your life. I mean, I don't think I've ever heard a security officer
talk about security through obfuscation, but I definitely see the, I can see the utility in
this case. I mean, it sounds like it's going to become more and more required, especially like
what's happening in the UK right now, right? You can't even post on social media anymore
without the threat of coercion. That terrifies me. I don't know if you've ever kept up to date
with that at all. Yeah. But also in the long term, I'm somewhat pessimistic on the physical
privacy stuff too. Thankfully, we don't have a ton of like physical surveillance in America,
at least outside of the big cities. But to give you an example, like I have
toll booth scanner thing, right? And thankfully, even though that's tracking
what the car is going through, my car is not registered to me, the toll booth scanner thing
is also registered to a corporation. But they could be taking photos and potentially doing
facial recognition as you're passing through there. And in general, I do expect that we're
going to hit a point where I won't be able to go out into meat space and not be recognized.
And, you know, one of the reasons for that is things like, you know, I think Metta has those
Rayban glasses, for example, that have the camera built into them, kind of like Google
Glass from a decade ago, but even better. And you know, it's only a matter of time before people
are going to have like built into their glasses, if not contact lenses, augmented reality display
that will be able to like pick up your faces, run facial recognition against them, and then
immediately like display a lot of information about you. And, you know, I have no real counter
measure to facial recognition. Yeah. Yeah, everyone will have a body cam one way or the
I mean, they already do it's just in their pockets, right? Yes.
That's a tough problem. I guess in speaking of like counter measures, is there any like
this bit, you know, obviously, like other sort of privacy projects have come up, such as like
a Zcash or Monero, trying to address some of these issues that, you know, are found in Bitcoin,
for example, are you hopeful for for similar methods to be employed by Bitcoin or how do you
think these things should operate or evolve in any way?
Well, I am doubtful we will ever see privacy protection that's this sort of Monero or shielded
Zcash transaction level of privacy, because those make it difficult to audit the supply
against inflation bugs, for example. I think Zcash actually had
an inflation bug. I think they don't think that it was exploited, but there was an inflation
bug at some point. And, you know, there are a number of potential privacy improvements,
but these are all going to be sort of iterative. I actually was on a panel a few weeks ago where
we were talking about cross input signature aggregation. And the short version to that is that
like, there is a potential path to a future in which Bitcoin economically incentivizes it
for you to participate in coin join mixing, where it would be cheaper to transact via coin join
than to just do a regular transaction. And that's, that would, I would say be my most
optimistic take on improving Bitcoin privacy is if we can do so in such a way that
economically incentivizes people to use it, because once again, people don't care about
privacy, but they do care about saving money. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well, we're out of time,
unfortunately, I'd love to continue chatting with you. I guess like to wrap it up, what are you
most hopeful for or like, you know, what are you excited for in the upcoming short or medium term
future? And, you know, if there's any other recommended reads that the audience should
check out? Well, in Bitcoin land, the past year has been interesting because it seems like we're
seeing an acceleration of development of people playing around with what you could call layer two
technologies. I would say a lot of them are centralized in various ways or are speculative
upon certain changes happening to the base layer protocol. And this is, I think, going to be one
of the main things that I'm going to be harping on and pushing for is that there's a lot of people
in the Bitcoin space who believe that like Bitcoin can do anything and you can build anything on top
of Bitcoin, you know, just look at lightning, for example. But they're also the sort of
ossifiers, they're like, they're too afraid of changing the base protocol. And one of the things
I'm going to be trying to get across to people is like, look, like lightning itself wouldn't
exist if we hadn't made three changes to the base protocol to enable it. And there are a number of
proposed changes to the base protocol that would enable a greater explosion of innovation in the
second layer space. And that's, I think, the main thing that I want to see happen is just improvements
that allow for more building on top of Bitcoin without having to make tradeoffs of having like
centralized gatekeepers like in and out of second layers. It's this, the promise that we were given
a decade ago with the side chains, white paper, that we were going to have this, you know, massive
ecosystem of many pegged chains to each other. And that never happened because we never actually got
a working trustless two way pegging mechanism. But if we can get something like that, and there are
some proposals that I think would make it feasible, then perhaps we will really see a new renaissance
of building on top of Bitcoin. Fingers crossed. I'm looking forward to it. All right. Well,
thank you so much for your time. Thanks for having me.

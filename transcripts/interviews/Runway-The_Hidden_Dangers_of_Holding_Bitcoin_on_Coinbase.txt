You know, if you are holding your money on Coinbase and in the normal brokerage, which like the vast
majority of people do, they do have security issues where I have seen countless people get
SIM swapped. As the technical best practices and security in the space continue to ratchet up,
the biggest weakness actually becomes the human. Yeah. So, you know, why try to hack a multi-million
dollar internet infrastructure that has, you know, amazing team of experts securing it when you can
just call up Granny on the phone and say the right things to get them to hand over the keys to the
kingdom. I've also been behind the scenes for a long time and my team has encouraged me to be more
public and it's like, I just see a more pervasive focus. What are your thoughts on all this? You
mentioned it is a little more comfortable coming to such a large conference, right? It's a risk.
It is a risk being a known Bitcoiner, especially a known early Bitcoiner because people are going to
assume that you've got a billion dollars and you're just walking around and all they need to do is
find the right time to kidnap you and start beating you, right? And so, you know, that's one of the
many things, of course, that I track is what is the evolution of the physical security of the
whole Bitcoin space and Bitcoin holders in general and how is the criminal element evolving?
Because this is security as a constant cat and mouse game. Very true, very true.
We're here at day three of the Bitcoin conference here in Nashville. I'm here with Jamison Lopp.
We're going to just have a quick conversation and ask him some questions and talk a little bit
about Bitcoin. So, welcome. Thanks for talking to me, Jamison. Appreciate it. Always happy to talk
about Bitcoin. So, I'm a big fan of your work. I've been listening to you for feels like a decade
almost now at this point, right? Accurate. Accurate, right? You know, I think you've had some great
episodes with like Peter McCormick early on, which I really jived with and listened to. So,
thank you for all your contributions to the space. How do you feel about this Bitcoin conference?
Like, what are your thoughts picking away from day three? It's different, right? I mean, look,
I'm a technologist. I prefer going to the really nerdy small conferences where I don't get stopped
every 20 feet by people who want to either pitch me something or fanboy or whatever. It's a very
different vibe as the space goes mainstream. And of course, now we're at the like heads of state
politicians coming in. And I mean, I'm not a fan of like political pandering and stuff. So, it'll
be interesting to see how many of the promises from the politicians actually come true. But,
I mean, it's just, it's a fascinating thing to observe the evolution. Yes, it is. It's the game
theory, right? Because, you know, Bitcoin works for so many different reasons. And it's not just
the technological reasons. It's because, for whatever reason, Satoshi managed to hit on like
just the right game theory, the incentive structure of all the different moving pieces.
Fucking brilliant, man. Fucking brilliant. If you really go down the cypherpunk rabbit hole and
look at all the stuff he did, it's just, you know, every day I almost learned something about Bitcoin,
right? Today, I was learning about side chains and all sorts of stuff. I mean, there's just so
many fascinating holes you can go down. I've also been behind the scenes for a long time. And my
team has encouraged me to be more public. And it's four years have been a little bit further. It's
been a lot more political antagonism, right? Which was predicted in the game theory and
talked about, first they fight you, and then they join you all these different things, right?
As like a privacy, a more privacy-focused activist, what are your thoughts on all this?
You know, as you mentioned, it is a little more uncomfortable coming to such a large conference,
right? I feel more at home at like mining disrupt and like the mining conferences personally,
because that's my little niche within Bitcoin. But for you, obviously, you've put out a lot of
content and, you know, very privacy-focused. What are your thoughts? It's a risk. I'm taking a
calculated risk. And I think a lot of the other people kind of in my same peer group,
I mean, whether they know it or not, and I think a lot of them still haven't realized it.
And I keep trying to bang it into their heads. Like this is a risk. It is a risk being a known
Bitcoin or especially a known early Bitcoin or because people are going to assume that you've
got a billion dollars and you're just walking around and all they need to do is find the right
time to kidnap you and start beating you, right? Or to find where you live. And so, you know,
that's one of the many things, of course, that I track is what is the evolution of the physical
security of the whole Bitcoin space and Bitcoin holders in general? And how is the criminal
element evolving? Because security is a constant cat and mouse game.
Very true. Very true. Very true. I mean, part of it is, you know, hey, you know, put it on record,
you know, my Bitcoin is in a cold storage device. I don't have access to it. I can't give it to you,
you know, and that's, you know, for myself, that's largely, that is true, right? So,
majority of my Bitcoin is like, yeah, you can get a couple hundred dollars worth out of me on my
hot wallet or whatever, but you're not going to be able to, no matter what you do to me,
you're not going to be able to get it because it's stored in, you know, in a safe somewhere or
somewhere private. And, you know, yeah. And this is something that I have more of a front row seat
to because I run a security company. So, we have clients and very small percentage of them who
have been attacked, but the ones who have been attacked, there have been very specific methodical
targeting of people like doing surveillance on them to figure out a lot about them in order to
more perfectly attack them and, you know, extract maximum value. So, talk to me a little bit about
Casa. What are you excited about that you guys have? What did you have to, you know, really get
involved there? Yeah, well, you know, the primary thing is we keep learning like what the best
practices are when it comes to security for your Bitcoin. And we learn from other people's mistakes,
you know, preferably not from our own mistakes. But, you know, before I founded Casa, I was at
Vico for several years. And, you know, we had several mistakes there. And we learned, we iterated,
we patched up vulnerabilities. And what we do at Casa is we take the best practices and we combine
that with the best hardware and we write what we hope is like the best, most useful, easy to use
software. And then we train Bitcoin experts to basically be like me and be able to actually get
on the phone with people and help them make, you know, very consequential decisions about their
Bitcoin holdings and keys and even planning with things of like inheritance. I do the same thing
for all the old ladies at my Bitcoin meetup. I just don't get paid for it. Yeah. And, you know,
and I think that that's true for a lot of people. Like this is one of the ways that the sort of
viral nature of the Bitcoin network works is that a lot of people get into it because someone that
they trust has been into it and can, you know, convey some of that knowledge to them.
Very true. What are your thoughts about these ETFs and the security behind those? I often think
about this, right? Because it seems like everybody now is just using Coinbase to custody everything.
Everything's there. It's like, it seems like that could be a major point of vulnerability there. I
mean, and the current administration, the government has done no favors to that. They've
actually made it worse because, you know, it's impossible for a, you know, for there to be
different custodians, especially ones that are in the industry of being custodians, banks, whatever,
that do that for a living. And you'd hope to have more participants so you could spread and
diversify that risk. And instead, what seemed to happen is that, you know, everybody's using
Coinbase Prime and that's it. What are your thoughts there? Well, I could talk about that for an hour,
but we're going to have to. Yeah, I mean, today, though. Okay, so I have a point. I have multiple
issues. So first of all, I'll state that as far as I'm aware, I have no reason to believe that
Coinbase has poor security practices for their cold storage, but we don't know what those are,
right? It's a black box. But I have no reason to believe that they're doing poorly there. Like,
they have spoken about some of their practices in the past and they were quite impressive.
However, I will say that, you know, if you are holding your money on Coinbase in the normal
brokerage, which like the vast majority of people do, they do have security issues where I have seen
countless people like get SIM swapped and get your funds completely. We probably get like,
you know, once a month at the meetup, we get somebody with, you know, hey, this happened or
yeah. And the social engineering is also becoming more sophisticated. As we've heard
from John Seth, you know, getting the recording of one of those like 20 year old or if not like
teenage social engineers, they're going out there and they're realizing that the,
as the technical best practices and security in the space continue to ratchet up, the biggest
weakness actually becomes the human. So, you know, why try to hack a multi-million dollar
internet infrastructure that has, you know, amazing team of experts securing it when you can just
call up Granny on the phone and say the right things to get them to hand over the keys to the
kingdom. With AI and, you know, the voice generation and all this stuff, it's, I mean, this is,
it's an interesting field and it's like a kind of a by no means an expert in your domain of the
privacy aspect of security and all that. I'd like to learn about it and I try my best and,
you know, try to get, just know enough to be secure, right? But it's like a cat and mouse game,
watching it evolve and change over time. Yeah, so, you know, we're never going to
perfectly solve everything. The only thing that I think we can really hope for is we keep
pushing the bar forward. And it really, it is a matter of
making people comfortable with taking on some responsibility. And if anything, this may be
a multi-generational societal level shift that needs to happen, because if you look at the
arc of history, it makes sense how we got to where we are today. We have evolved our society and
our economy through specialization of tasks. This allows for people to be far more efficient
by, you know, optimizing one very specific thing. And the result of that is that we've
created a civilization where you outsource many, many aspects of your life. And this is great from
an economic perspective because your quality of life goes up. But what we, I think, never really
realized until very recently is that this actually introduces a lot of systemic risk and fragility
into the fabric of society itself. No doubt, no doubt, no doubt about that at all, right? And
just even, you know, what you said, personal responsibility and accountability, it's just
the culture of society itself at this point. There's, you know, we're lacking in that area.
I think it's obvious to see nobody wants to take personal accountability, personal responsibility
for the decisions, right? You know, like, I see it even at the meetup when it's like, oh, you know,
talking to people that get scammed, it's like, you know, hey, listen, you know, this sucks, it
happened. But like, how can we prevent this from happening again? What did you do wrong here?
You know, you know, some people, I sat with you when we went over to Ledger,
you know, we looked at the seed phrase, you know,
I made you, I wasn't going to help you go through the whole procedure, right? I made you
write down, I told you I can't look, I told you never give this to anybody. So like, why did you
give it to somebody, right? These little things, right? And, you know, again, people are always
going to make mistakes. And part of life is you learn from your mistakes, right? So I've never
had somebody that got scammed. You know, personally, from people that I know, I've never had, I've
never seen one of those people get scammed again. Right? So you learn your lesson, you get your
education. And again, all this stuff, this is such a nascent technology that like, it's not in the
education system, no one's learning about this in school. I mean, this is the only way to learn is
that you have to go seek it out, right? So hopefully in the future, we'll see that. And
the educational scene is changing. I mean, even what they did this year at the conference,
the Bitcoin camp for kids, I think that's fucking awesome, right? The other thing,
you got to get them started young. Yep. Yep. Yep. So what are you most excited about
for the next couple of years in the industry ecosystem?
Well, I mean, you know, since I focus on the technology side, for me, it's more about continuing
to shepherd, especially scalability improvements. But the thing that I'm most focused on is that
we can get a few protocol changes in that will actually just open up the ability for people
to develop Bitcoin related layers. Right now, it's just way too difficult.
Do you think that's possible? I mean, it seems like the protocol itself is so resistant to any
change, especially at that base layer. That's an uphill battle. I mean, I think it's possible,
because we already have a number of good improvement proposals. And we know that like,
they can be implemented. Like the code already exists in many cases. It's just a matter of
really, which one are you most excited about right now? And what's the biggest resistance?
Yeah, I mean, I think in terms of new functionality, Opcat seems to be one of the more powerful things.
But Rusty Russell came out recently with this idea of like the script, great script restoration
project, which is basically re-enable a lot of the original functionality that got turned off
many, many years ago. But Satoshi turned that off and they're correct.
Correct. I think he just wanted to make sure everything.
Yeah, not as an abundance of caution, which, you know, out of the base layer makes sense, right?
Right. But now we actually, and one of the reasons why we know that it's safe to do this,
is that there are other networks like Bitcoin Cash that re-enabled that something years ago.
So like, we know that it's possible to run these other parts of the protocol safely.
And that would enable more permissionless innovation of people to, you know, create other layers.
You're not wrong. You're not wrong at all. I think Vitalik, I think a long time ago,
was talking kind of about what you're saying. And that's eventually why he went and founded
Ethereum to have a different programming language that was more...
Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's part of the problem is that if it's too difficult for people to build
in the Bitcoin ecosystem and there is some specific functionality that they're striving for,
then they're going to take the path of least resistance.
Yeah, no makes sense. And you know what? Kudos to a lot of these other...
A lot of people are like, screw all these other networks. Well, they're experimenting,
they're testing things, and Bitcoin can see what works, what doesn't, and potentially institute
change. And I'm not personally opposed to that. I mean, I think the base case is this global
digital store value, this decentralized money, and this permissionless money that
is ultimately decentralized. And I think as long as we can keep that,
we can potentially do other things as long as we know that they're safe. So,
very interesting, very interesting. I don't want to take up too much of your time.
I really appreciate you hopping out. Me have followed you for a long time and followed your
work. So thank you for all that you've done. I appreciate it. And we're launching a new podcast
here pretty soon called Cypherpunk. So love to have you on sometime. My first guest is going to be
Aaron Van Weirdum. He's coming down for a week or two to come with me and we're going to dive into
his book. So, Genesis. Yeah, so you have a very good song coming. Oh, I have. Oh, it's fantastic.
It is. Yeah. Yeah. So thank you, brother. Appreciate it. You're a bet.

What is up, everybody? I'm Scott Melker and you're listening to the Wolf of All Streets
podcast. Today's guest is an original cypherpunk. Jameson discovered Bitcoin early and has done
extensive work advocating for its privacy and protection from governments and other threats.
He's the founder of one of my favorite companies who I use, Casa, where Bitcoin holders can protect
their assets like never before. Jameson Lottman, thanks so much for taking the time to come on the
show. It's great to be here. I've actually been a Scott Melker fan since the early days. I was
actually looking back on my tweets and I found one from 2014 where I was telling Nick Carey at
blockchain to listen to your stuff. When we first connected, that blew my mind.
Absolutely. Because I've been obviously quietly following you for such a long time in the Bitcoin
space. And then I found out that you've been blasting ball of notes in your car. That was
pretty cool. So before we get into the questions, once again, everyone, you're listening to the Wolf
of All Streets podcast where twice a week I talk to your favorite personalities from the worlds of
Bitcoin, finance, trading, art, music, sports, politics. This show is powered by BlockWorks Group,
a media company with over 20 podcasts in their network. You can check them out at
blockworksgroup.io. If you like the podcast, you follow me on Twitter, you need to check out my
website and join the newsletter. You can do both those things at thewolfofallstreets.io. So now
that we're done with that part, let's get into what's actually interesting here. So obviously,
you were a very early adopter. You've been in this space. People know that you've been an advocate
for Bitcoin for a very long time. How did your Bitcoin journey sort of start?
Both from the technical perspective and philosophical. I mean, I have been a programmer
my entire career, got a computer science degree. And so I hung out on a lot of the nerd sites.
I'm pretty sure that the time that I finally actually decided to look into Bitcoin was from
a Slashdot article. I know I had heard of it a few times before then on other geeky tech sites
and generally dismissed it. But that third or fourth time I heard about it is when I actually
went and read the white paper. And that's when the technical side of me was like, oh, snap,
this is actually a very elegant solution. And I don't think that it's gonna get hacked and
cause everybody to lose their money. It's actually much more robust than I assumed that it was going
to be because nothing like that had ever existed before. So that got me intrigued from the technical
side. And then on the philosophical side, once I really started thinking about what is money,
because most people don't go that deep, they just use what's given to them, then I realized that
money as this abstract concept is something that should not be controlled by any single group.
It's something that it really ought to be a consensus driven project where anyone who cares
can chip in and say, I think the ideal money should work like this. So money as an open
source project, I thought was a really fascinating concept. And basically decided at that point that
I wanted to understand this Bitcoin thing as much as possible. And after doing some
side projects for a few years, I was eventually lucky enough that Venture Capital flowed into
the space and I was able to just work on it full time.
And what year was that? And what did that look like when Venture Capital first came into the
space? Was it Casa? Was it something else? What were you working on at that point?
Yeah. So when I realized that I was already spending most of my waking hours thinking about
Bitcoin and shirking my regular job duties, it was like late 2014 when I started doing
my routine when I started looking at jobs. I actually applied to Coinbase and a few other
places. And I, however, did not want to move to Silicon Valley. So that made it a little
bit trickier. And I ended up actually getting a job building infrastructure at BitGo doing
multi-sig enterprise, sort of hot wallet handling for exchanges and other payment processors.
So that's where I really got to learn a lot more about the cyber security aspects of the
space. And we had a wild ride from 2015 through 2017, just trying to keep up with everything.
And then it was early 2018 when I basically decided to pivot very slightly. And instead
of focusing on enterprise Bitcoin security and crypto key management, instead now I'm
focusing on individual key management, trying to help normal people be their own bank and
really attain the promise that Bitcoin has always made it technically possible, but has
usually been out of reach for most people. That's interesting. You and I have discussed
this before separately, but it's sort of like the evolutionary chart of security for people,
right? You come into Bitcoin, you buy some Bitcoin on an exchange. Okay, fine. It's safe.
Then you see a story about a hack and you move on to maybe self-custody. You buy a ledger or
something like that. And then it grows and you start to worry about yourself as your
single point of failure. If I die, if I forget it, if I bump my head, all these things. And then
I think you eventually land at multi-sig. So what is it that drove you to focus more on retail?
And why do you think that people should be that concerned about their security and securing their
assets? I felt like we had done a pretty good job progressing enterprise security. And really,
as of today, there are a lot of best practices. There's even the cryptocurrency security standard,
which if exchanges and other enterprises adhere to the recommendations of even tier one of that
standard, then it's pretty unlikely that they're going to get hacked. Now, we still see hacks
happen all the time because new companies come into the space, new exchanges pop up, and they
don't know jack about Bitcoin security or crypto security. And they make the same mistakes that a
lot of people have made before. And so that's why we're going to keep seeing those types of hacks.
But I believe that the best practices already exist. So if you actually care enough to look
into it, then a dedicated team of experts can secure private key material pretty well. However,
for the individual to do that, it's still a really high learning curve. It can take days, weeks,
months of education to learn not just the basics, but then like kind of what you were talking about,
you get into more and more edge cases of things that are less likely to happen. But still,
when we're talking about something where a single catastrophic mistake can cause you to lose
everything, then you want to have all the bases covered. So I realized that even after working
full time doing Bitcoin key management for three years, my own personal setup was still a huge pain
to actually keep updated. I was spending basically a weekend every year. At the turn of the year,
I would have a little calendar reminder that said, okay, update all your cold storage. This is going
to be a really boring pain in the ass, but you've got to do it because a lot of your net worth is
tied up in this stuff. So I realized if it was that big of a pain for me, then the vast majority
of people were not going to follow many of the best practices. And at the micro level, that means
that these individuals are going to be less secure. They might end up losing their money. But at the
macro level, it's even more concerning because I think that that means that more people are going
to just be lazy and leave their money with third party custodians. And then we're just right back
where we started with, or we just reinvented the banking system all over again. And that creates
a systemic risk. And I am concerned about where we might end up decades from now. Because if you
really want Bitcoin to be like the world reserve currency, you have to think of this in terms of
generations. And if we keep sliding in the direction that it seems like we're going,
then having the vast majority of keys held by a small number of entities creates new types of
attack vectors. And I don't want us to ever have to worry about that. So there's the security side,
obviously, and then you have to think ahead of the security side. But there's also the philosophical
side that you just touched on, which is if everything's just going to become another bank
for Bitcoin, what was the point, right? You know, the whole appeal for people who get it, I guess,
is to be your own bank and somewhat opt out of the system, right?
Yeah. So it's funny because when you get really deep into it, it seems like almost everything
that there is to talk about Bitcoin has already been talked about. Like if you go trawling through
the early 2009, 2010 Bitcoin talk posts, and it was actually Hal Finney, who originally was
envisioning Bitcoin as ending up like that, where the vast majority of Bitcoin was held by
some sort of custodians. And he seemed to think that, you know, that was the natural way for the
system to scale. But I think that there's still plenty of opportunity for us to try to prevent
a future like that from happening. So the argument was kind of, you know, sure, you'd still have a
lot of people that were sort of voluntarily trusting third parties, but at least you wouldn't have a
single central bank that could then easily debase the currency. So even if we got into that situation,
there's an argument that at least maybe the 21 million, you know, total supply would stay
the same. But I would argue that the guarantees around that become a lot weaker as the number
of coins that are held by different entities, you know, continues to consolidate.
It's interesting, though, because like, the community in general, and myself included,
like, if you're talking about the price of Bitcoin, you see a lot of these,
the big news is very bullish, right? The OCC saying that banks can custody Bitcoin,
Kraken becoming a bank in Wyoming, you know, PayPal, Venmo, Square, these huge things. But,
I mean, to your point, maybe that's good for price, but not good for Bitcoin long term.
Is that I mean, is that somewhat accurate? It kind of comes down to coordination costs,
right? Is that the whole point of Bitcoin as a protocol is to create this machine consensus
that essentially automates the coordination of the auditing of the financial system.
And that is great. Like, that's where the real value of this system is. It's actually efficient
from a global coordination mechanism, even though we're burning a ton of energy to secure it.
It's arguably more efficient than having a lot of human auditors trying to come to consensus,
you know, on a daily basis. But then at the human level, the problem is that the machine consensus,
while that is a very low level of like the Bitcoin network and the Bitcoin protocol,
beneath that there is always the human consensus level. It's like humans can always theoretically
come to a new consensus to change the rules of the system if they update the code that they're
running. And then the question becomes, how could that potentially be weaponized and become an
attack vector if the number of humans who have to coordinate that are, you know, small enough that
they can actually come to an agreement about something that perhaps the wider ecosystem does
not agree about? And of course, that's where you get into all the scaling war stuff, the, you know,
2X and Bitcoin cash hard fork and all the other stuff of like, who actually decides the changes?
And are they able to like pull along the rest of the majority of the system, even if they
are in disagreement? We also hear that mining is highly centralized, right? I mean, that it's four
or five companies, whatever, doing the bulk of, you know, all are controlling bulk of the hash
rate. So is that another concern, you know, similar to what you're discussing? Or is that
something separate? You know, it's kind of related, but it's got its own complexities. I actually
wrote a blog post a couple of months ago, entitled like, does China's mining power pose a threat to
Bitcoin? And that, I think, becomes an issue if you're talking about nation state attacks, like
what could a nation state that like nationalize all the miners within their borders possibly do?
And the nice thing about mining is that it doesn't allow you to change the rules of the system. It
only allows you to decide, you know, which blocks are going into the blockchain, and they still
have to be valid. So the biggest attack, well, two different attacks that could really happen. One is
that if a miner already has a lot of money, they can double spend their own money, and they would
most likely be attacking exchanges. And from a nation state standpoint, if like China was going
to do that, then I would like start attacking the American exchanges and the European exchanges and
you know, try to steal all the as many coins as possible from them. The sort of nuclear option
that a nation state could do is to just censor everything, you know, only create empty blocks,
don't allow any transactions to go into the blockchain. And you know, that could cause a
massive loss of confidence. But then there's a question like, how long do they sustain that?
Because it's not cheap to do. So there's always other counters to this, like you can go through
all possible different paths of what could happen. And, and ultimately, like the network and the
global community, as it were, would notice very quickly if these types of shenanigans happen.
And so then, like I said, we would know that something funky was going on at the machine
consensus level, we fall back to the human consensus level, and then we have to decide
what do we do. The nuclear option there is you could potentially nullify all of the miners
hardware by changing the algorithm for mining. And you know, that would kind of be like a massive
reset and probably like pushes back to GPU mining for a while. But it's something we want to avoid.
And the nice thing is that I think from a mining standpoint, it seems like it's becoming more
competitive. It seems like we're seeing more miners that are using like renewables and things
like captured like excess natural gas and stuff. And they're basically dispersing throughout the
world. So it's not all just going to be like Chinese hydro mining, but rather a diversity
of different cheap renewable energy sources all over the world. Yeah, I'm blanking on the company
level something, but they're in Texas. And I know that they're selling a ton of electricity back to
the grid to offset the cost and make sure that reuse I mean, there's going to be novel solutions
for the electricity problem you have to imagine. I mean, in a world where we have this many smart
people who are working on it, you know, I don't think that that's going to be a huge issue.
So you touched on definitely the nation state, I guess threat to Bitcoin. What are the other threats
to the future of Bitcoin or at least the future that you the ideal future of Bitcoin in your mind
are the biggest threats governments? Is it companies? Is it hacks? What is it?
Well, I've said for I think quite a few years that I felt like the biggest threat to Bitcoin was
apathy. So that basically means that, you know, we get stuck where we are right now, we stop growing,
and it remains a fairly niche thing. Now, you know, with the news just in the recent weeks
and months, and you know, all the crazy stuff going on this year, from a macro standpoint,
it seems highly unlikely, you know, it seems like we are trending in the right direction there where
as an asset, Bitcoin is actually becoming more and more accepted that it's not going away,
that it is actually something that you can depend upon. So I'm fairly confident there
that, you know, the momentum and the network effect is already high enough that it's not
going anywhere. And I'm even somewhat optimistic that the nation state threat is less of an issue
because I believe that we've heard a number of reports that there are plenty of politicians
who, you know, are already invested, like the politicians aren't stupid, they know how the
game works. And they want to opt out of the current system as well. So, you know, that, of course,
changes the incentives of it's unlikely that nation states are going to try to ban Bitcoin if a lot of
the politicians already own it. Yeah, I mean, they'd much rather capitalize it than kill it,
right? Yeah, Bitcoin works because, you know, the incentives are aligned and greed is good,
and it makes people predictable. And as you said, you know, they know better than anyone else,
the hazards of policy, right? I mean, your average politician in Washington has to be aware of the
effects of endless money printing in QE and failed. So you talked about apathy as being the biggest
threat, which I think is really interesting. And I agree with you. I think that's not a threat
anymore. If that was going to happen, wouldn't it have happened when, you know, we saw the bubble
pop in 2018-19? I mean, you've been in this for almost 10 years, you know, almost a decade. Isn't
this like the maximalist wet dream scenario right now? I mean, that's it's what you guys have been
saying was going to happen, the money printing and the sort of all of these issues with monetary
policy. Isn't it here? I mean, isn't this the time? Yeah, you know, it's hard not to have like
the Schadenfreude or whatever. I tell some people that, you know, what's really better than, you
know, the price going up, orders of magnitude. What is really more comforting to me is being right.
It's like, I'm basically being proven that I wasn't crazy for so many years. You know, so many
people looked down on me and said that I was, you know, the crazy libertarian nutjob who was talking
about things that were never going to happen. And, you know, there was never any guarantee that it
was going to happen this quickly. That was really, I would say, the biggest surprise is that when I
first bought Bitcoin as an asset, I did so as a hedge. I didn't think, oh, this thing is going to
make me rich. I was rather that, you know, I knew that over the course of my life that my dollars
were going to become worth less. And so I was going to put them into a system that seemed like
it was less likely to decrease in value. And I am not an investor or really, I'm a terrible trader.
Oh my goodness. I would say the vast majority of my trades over the years have been losers.
There haven't been many of them. Like the only really good trades that I would say I've done
over the past decade, I've had a couple of good stock trades like Netflix and Amazon.
On the crypto side, obviously dollars to Bitcoin has been good. I've lost money on most of my other
crypto to crypto trades. But the only crypto to crypto trade that has turned out really well for
me is selling off all my Bitcoin forks for more Bitcoin. But even then, I would have done better
if I had sold them for Fiat and then waited for the market to crash and then bought more Bitcoin.
Yeah, I know that's perfect. I mean, traders lose money. That's the way it is. And I mean,
wealth is accumulated certainly in a space like this by just being early and believing and buying
and buying and forgetting about it. And I'm assuming that's largely what you've done. I mean,
they say 95% of traders lose everything. Yeah. And it's hard to put a number on it,
but I would say that the vast majority of people who got in really early did not hold through
multiple bubbles. And the only reason why I have held through multiple bubbles is because I've
always considered this to be a multi-generational asset. I was not trying to flip it into something
else. I didn't need the money to sell, to buy other things. I've always been privileged enough
to have the skills to have high paying software engineering jobs. So this entire time, I've just
continued living, basically tried to continue living like I'm only earning 50 or $60,000 a year
and not inflating my lifestyle. And perhaps someday I'll go buy a private island or something,
but I don't feel the need to do that because we still have so much work to do. And this really
has always been more of an ideological mission for me rather than a profit-driven thing.
So interesting because you hear the criticism all the time. I'll call it a criticism that people
who were early and got rich were lucky, right? And you hear it all the time, like, oh, they just
happened to buy it, but you touched on the most important point. Buying it is nothing.
Holding it through all of that requires just hands of steel, right? So I mean, there's no luck.
Yeah. I would say there is also luck in the sense that there are always novel types of attacks and
forms of loss that are being discovered. And so I've had my fair share of close calls where I
almost lost a lot of money. And you'll probably find this funny, but because of what a terrible
trader I am and just not really understanding trading very much, I lost a decent amount of
money by accidentally crashing the Litecoin market on Coinbase. Was it like a fat finger?
I just did not understand how illiquid Litecoin was at the time. And I was used to making
six-figure trades in Bitcoin and just market order done. And it was like maybe a $30,000 or $40,000
Litecoin sale and it crashed the Litecoin market. And so I basically ended up losing
half of that to slippage, but live and learn. Yeah. And I think that a lot of people have
experienced that sort of in the altcoin market. Certainly if you were early, but still, I mean,
we have DeFi and Uniswap and stuff where you can press the wrong button and send something
literally to zero in a matter of moments. So I want to talk about security basics. But I don't,
obviously, I don't often have the opportunity to have someone on the show who really understands
or can explain from the lowest to the highest level what people should be doing. So I guess
we have people that are coming into the space for the first time. As I touched on before,
they're buying and just leaving it on an exchange. What are the most basic steps that every person
who's in crypto or just every person in general for their privacy should be taking at least to
maintain some privacy and security? Privacy is a lot harder than security. And that is
because it mainly comes down to what are the on-ramps and off-ramps that you're using.
So I suspect the vast majority of people are going to be using your standard centralized
exchanges, the vast majority of which are doing AML, KYC, at least if you're doing anything
more than trivial amounts. So if you want to get in and out of the space through Fiat rails,
and you don't want to give up all of your identity information, then you either need to do
face-to-face trades, which are actually a security risk. And that's where the vast majority of armed
robberies happen in this space is meeting people with large amounts of cash. And I actually have a
whole repository dedicated to keeping track of those types of attacks. Otherwise, it gets
more technically challenging because you can acquire and dispose of the assets through AML,
KYC, but then use various technical methods on these networks to either mix the funds or try to
hop between different chains. Of course, there are costs associated with that and additional
risks of potentially losing everything. And really, the way that I approach most of the privacy
stuff is that I'm waiting for better privacy. I'm waiting for improved coin join, improved
aggregated signature stuff so that the mixing software is a lot stronger than it currently is.
And that's probably another reason why I don't really move a lot of money around is that every
time that you do that, every time you transact with someone else, you're potentially giving away
a lot of the details of your entire assets. So privacy is actually, I would say, one of the
latter things that you should worry about, because privacy doesn't matter at all if you
have terrible security and lose everything. So from a security perspective, I would recommend
keeping as little assets as possible with third parties. Obviously, you've got a lot of people
who are probably actively trading and watching your show, and they need to have something
available in order to make trades on short notice. But that should be only a small part of your stack.
And if you have the vast majority of your funds on exchanges, even if they're dispersed between
multiple different exchanges, you're at much higher risk than if you have a robust self-custody setup.
And this is actually something that I've heard fairly frequently is people believing that because
they have their funds in many different places that they're safer. And it's an interesting
conundrum because what you're doing is you're pushing the risk around, you're spreading the
risk out that you have a single catastrophic event that causes you to lose everything.
So you are safer from that perspective. However, on the flip side, what you're also doing is you're
increasing the risk that something goes wrong and you lose some portion of your assets.
So that's some other mental math that people need to be aware of. So what I focus on is how do you
create one single robust setup that is essentially impermeable and is flexible enough that we
understand that humans make mistakes and we want to make sure that those mistakes, those accidents,
those acts of God, nature, whatever, are not catastrophic but rather are just minor annoyances
that you can then recover from. So there's multiple different, I would say, tiers or levels
of what you can do with your holdings. If all your stuff is on an exchange, you don't actually own
any crypto. You have crypto IOUs and you're hoping that that exchange doesn't go bust.
And there are the arguments to be made that you're essentially a creditor to that exchange,
but you don't even have creditor's rights. I think if there's a liquidation event,
you're going to be the last in line to get any money. I mean, just look at what happened with
Mt. Gox. How many years has it been? Six years ago. And there are still people waiting. Like,
there's what? 150, 200,000 Bitcoin that are still just sitting with some trust guy in Japan who's
trying to figure out what the hell he's going to do with it. And that's a good outcome because
at least they have something that eventually should get paid off. But going from there,
the next step is just taking control of your own keys. You can put them into a software wallet
that's not great. There's still a ton of technical hacks and attacks that can happen there.
Going to a hardware wallet is really the great next step and it's fairly easy. Ledger, Trezor,
Cold Card, what have you. And that will protect you from the vast majority of remote technical
attacks. You're then still going to be open to social attacks like phishing type stuff is what
we're seeing a lot more these days because now the weak point is the brain. It's the human
getting them to press the button to authorize the money to go out. And then the other thing that a
lot of people don't spend a lot of time thinking about is just yourself. It's like you are one of
your biggest weaknesses and not having a robust setup. You could lose all of your money due to a
house fire if you don't have geographically distributed backups, for example. And I would
say that that is really the bread and butter and value add of our setup at Casa is putting the user
into an architecture where they don't have to think about it. They don't have to spend a lot of
time thinking through everything that could go wrong because we've already done that.
And then we've created software so that you're just following the instructions in the app,
but you're also having a client advisor that you can reach out to if you have any questions.
And by just following what we have told you to do in the software, you put yourself into a position
that I would argue is even more resilient, more robust than a traditional bank setup.
Because even if you're putting your gold bars into a vault in a bank, there could be some sort
of disaster that causes that building to blow up or fall down or fall into a hole if there's a
giant earthquake that opens up the ground. You never know. But when you have multiple different
sets of keys that all come together to secure one stash of crypto, and you can put those in
geographically secured locations, then it's like unless the entire side of the country gets nuked
or something, you can be rest assured that even if you lose one or two of those keys, you're still
going to be able to recover your funds. So that is where multi-SIG is what I consider the final
technical step. But multi-SIG is not a silver bullet. It really depends how you set it up.
And if you set it up the wrong way, it can effectively be the same as single SIG. And
that's what we had some sort of hard lessons over the years when we were in the early days
of doing multi-SIG setup, is finding out how people could screw it up and turn it into
single SIG. Are you sick of paying ridiculous fees to trade crypto? It's time you try Voyager.

Hey guys, I want to take a moment to talk about our sponsor Electroneum and their amazing new
platform, AnyTask.com, a place where freelancers can finally be paid for their work without needing
a bank. Freelancers match directly with potential clients and receive ETN as payment. Even better,
ETN can be spent in over 2000 physical and online locations worldwide. A lot of companies
talk the talk of mainstream adoption, but Electroneum is truly walking the walk. They're
banking the unbanked worldwide and offering opportunity to those who lack access to the
resources that many of us take for granted. In the next few months, they're also adding
more in-app purchases, including local food and supplies, paid TV, gaming, gift cards, and much
more. If you'd like to learn more, head on over to Electroneum.com. That's E-L-E-C-T-R-O-N-E-U-M.com.
Yeah, I think that the real light bulb moment for me, well, light bulb moment one was getting
SIM swapped, obviously, and having people attack me and multiple times and trying to hack me and
realizing that this was a real threat and that I couldn't take it casually. But then when you
actually start to secure yourself from that, you realize in the real light bulb moment,
as you said, is realizing what a point of vulnerability you are. And for me, that was
the biggest one. If I die, if my house comes on fire, if anything like you said, we all, you know,
if you're in ERC 20 coins and stuff, you probably have coins in five, six, 10 different places.
How's my wife going to find that? How are my kids going to find that if we're both going?
It sends you down the trap hole. That's what led me largely to you guys. You know,
we've discussed this at length. I was extremely impressed at how easy the process was because I've
you know, it seems very daunting at first to engage to even make the decision to go multisig
because, you know, three of five, you're going to have to set up five wallets and you're going to
have to disperse them. But you guys like you said, I mean, you have someone who holds your hand
literally the entire way. I mean, I feel like the people at your company are my friends who check
in on me once a week to make sure that I haven't done anything stupid. It's amazing. I mean, so
you have gotten to that point, right? I mean, you feel like now you have the product.
Yeah, I mean, we try to strive for like a private banking experience. You know, if you have
high net worth that you need to secure, you know, traditionally high net worth individuals,
they have private bankers who manage all the aspects of their financial life.
And we wanted to provide the same type of experience from a service perspective, but
do better than that because we don't want to actually control your money. You know,
we don't want to be a single point of failure where we could be coerced or we could screw up
or even have like an internal employee attack. You know, there have been exchanges and other
providers that have had rogue employees that have ended up stealing lots of money. So this is,
it's a high stakes game and we just want to help people help themselves.
That makes sense. And so, I mean, I've, obviously I said I've been simswapped and hacked, but you've
really, really gotten a big taste of the worst of the worst in this, right? I mean, I remember
reading the New York Times article about how you took yourself completely off the grid.
I know that the SWAT team came to your house a few years ago. I mean, can you talk about those
experiences, what happened and then how they sort of shaped your view? I guess why, I mean,
I think it'll tell, show people why you're so serious about privacy and security.
Yeah. And, you know, unfortunately I did not really like walk the walk when it came to privacy
until I had, you know, the massive jarring event that made me realize how exposed that I was,
is, you know, essentially rising to prominence during one of the bull runs,
it results in more people paying attention to you. And this is a common celebrity problem,
of course, traditional celebrities who have millions of people paying attention to them.
It's just a law of large numbers where eventually there are going to be some unhinged people who
are willing to do things that you wouldn't have considered. And so that's when, you know,
eventually someone figured, Hey, this guy's been in Bitcoin for a long time. Maybe I can screw with
him enough to extort him. And, you know, they had the technical ability to anonymously place a phone
call to my local police department and pretend to be me, say I had killed people and was, you know,
holed up in my house, you know, like barricade situation with explosives and all this other
stuff. So essentially they hacked the system, not only from a technical level, but they understood
that it's actually very easy if you say the right words to get a large amount of lethal force
targeted at really anyone you want, at least in the United States, this is easy to do. Yeah.
And it's really an asymmetric type of attack where, you know, the person who did this probably
spent less than a hundred dollars on like the technical aspects to be able to get away with it.
And in exchange, you know, they were essentially able to probably use hundreds of thousands of
dollars of public resources to shut down my entire neighborhood for the morning. And then,
you know, subsequently, who knows how much in like investigation, man hours got spent trying
to find them and failing. And yeah, that's when I realized that if you're in the space, then you are
a target, you know, not only digitally for some swapping stuff, but potentially also physically.
And while the, like the project where I keep track of physical attacks, I think
there have only been three or four dozen documented. I know there have been plenty
of other undocumented because most people, like after this happened to me, I had several people
reach out to me privately and tell me the same thing had happened to them. And I was like, well,
why the hell didn't you tell anybody? Yeah, they're scared. They don't want to become a target
again. And the other issue is that, of course, you know, I didn't go into all the details of
what happened until a year later after I had burned down my entire life and moved to a new
secure location where I felt like, okay, now I can actually talk about it. And for a variety of
reasons, of course, that's not an option for a lot of people. So unless you start out in the crypto
space with really strong operational security, then you're going to end up having to spend a
lot more on the back end. If you want to put yourself into a really good standpoint, I guess,
it really depends on what you're trying to protect yourself against. And I've written a number of
articles on this and it gets expensive. So it really depends on how much you think it's worth
to you. It's a new type of insurance. And this is really what I consider security and privacy,
both different types of insurance. There are a number of people who ask CASA, you know,
do you offer insurance on the Bitcoin that I store with you? And my response is, well,
you're obviously asking about traditional insurance, which is some sort of legal contract
where you hope that they will pay out. And, you know, if you follow along, you know, anything in
the insurance world, then you know that the insurer will do the most that they possibly can to not
pay you out if something happens to you. So insurance itself is not necessarily a great
insurance because the guarantees are often pretty flimsy. So instead, I think it's better to
insure yourself. And the way that you create guaranteed insurance is by setting up strong
privacy, setting up strong security in a way that you're not relying upon, once again, a third party.
If you're relying upon a third party for insurance payouts, then they might let you down. And that
would be pretty, pretty terrible to happen like in your time of need. You were able to completely
remove yourself from the system effectively, right? I mean, you, you know, if I recall, like,
you know, you started an anonymous company, basically, and did everything through the company,
you moved, you went as far as to buy a burner house, right? I mean, you bought a separate
house to have a different address just so the mail could go there and people wouldn't know
where you were. I mean, was that sort of an experiment to see if you could do it? Or was
it were you at the level where you were saying, I need to do this or somebody's gonna get me?
Yeah, it was both. You know, first of all, you know, the, the attack happened near,
it was like, as the 2017 bull run was really taking off. And so that's when a lot more people
were paying attention, including criminals. So I felt like, you know, I had a few years after that
of bear market where they were, I assumed there would be less of an issue, but it's always about
preparing for the next bull market. Whether that's a personal thing or a company thing,
it's like, you know, this is my second full cycle working in Bitcoin full time. And I can,
I can see a lot of parallels. And so, you know, one of the things that we've spent a lot of time
the past couple of years at the company doing is basically me telling everybody all the shit that
went wrong last cycle and how we need to prepare for it so that we don't get completely overwhelmed,
you know, when demand goes through the roof on the next cycle. And so that is going to continue
happen from a security perspective is, you know, if, if there's a 10 X move in the market,
then the entire world is going to be going crazy. But also what that means that criminals and people
who are willing to cause harm to others are going to get more interested in it. And they are going
to be experimenting too. So the stuff that I did, it was an experiment to try to push the envelope.
And you know, there were some things that went wrong. And I actually, I went through a whole
other cycle more recently to basically do it all over again and fix the things that went wrong
the first time. And, and so then, you know, eventually, hopefully in the next year or two,
there'll be another major bull run and we're going to see another new swath of criminal element come
in, try to figure out what are the risks and rewards of different types of attacks against
people in the crypto space. And I, I know I'm going to be a big target. So I want to have,
you know, an order of magnitude, more security and privacy than I think I need
so that I can weather those attacks. So it's interesting. There's kind of Bitcoin
and everything else when it comes to security. So I know that you guys, you know, multi-state
is a great, is a great strategy for people to secure their Bitcoin. But what about everything
else? So it depends from protocol to protocol, right? Any of the Bitcoin based protocols will
have the same multisig stuff. It will then just be a question of whether or not your wallet software
and hardware supports it. The completely different things like Ethereum does not have native
multisig. You basically have to use a multisig smart contract. I have blog posts about my
experience with that. It does seem like the Gnosis safe multisig smart contract has been well vetted
and I've not heard of any exploits against it. And I think it's been out there for a couple of
years now. So that's probably the best option for Ethereum folks. You know, Monero technically has
multisig, but as far as I'm still aware, there's not really any good interfaces into it. It's more
of a command line thing. And you know, the further down you get in the list, you know, the smaller
the community, the smaller the number of developers, the less likely there is going to be some sort of
robust multisig even offered to you. So what we've seen instead is some, some companies and projects
have used other types of things that are similar to multisig, but they're not actually like
on blockchain multisig. So you can do things like Shamir secret sharing. It has its own set of
gotchas, but it essentially allows you to split up keys. I think there are some companies that are
doing multi-party computation systems that can allow you to do the same thing. The tricky things
about both of those is they're novel. And I think like with the multi-party computation stuff,
I think a lot of it's not even open source. So you're, it's hard to evaluate, you know,
as time goes by. Yeah. As time goes by, we'll, you know, be able to gain more confidence in them
if they don't get exploited, but you know, there have been exploits. I think there was a,
there was a Shamir secret sharing in some Bitcoin wallet recently. They, they were doing this like
social key recovery thing. And basically an attacker, somebody, a researcher figured out
how to turn it from a like two out of three, basically into a single SIG once again. So
it's, it's hard to say, you know, this, we obviously get people asking us all the time,
like when are you going to add support for X, Y or Z? And it's just, it's such a heavy lift both
to evaluate and then to build on top of is that I still feel like we have so much work left to do
improving the Bitcoin experience that I wouldn't want to start working on something else until I
felt like I was finished and had the perfect polished Bitcoin vault available for people.
That makes sense. And we talked about, I guess, exchange security a bit earlier, but at least
it's encouraging, I think, I'm not saying it's certainly not the end all be all, but that they've
added things like white listing and, you know, hardware, you know, like a Ubico key to be able
to, I mean, do you think that the exchanges now are becoming far more secure, at least than they
were before, or do you still think that there are huge points of failure? I think the exchanges that
have been around for a long time are getting more secure, you know, Kraken, Gemini, Coinbase,
though last I checked Coinbase still had like SMS account recovery and 2FA and like there's still
plenty of people who are getting SIM swapped and losing their Coinbase funds. And I don't know why
the hell they still even allow that. Every SIM swap that I've heard of, people that I've talked
to, myself included, and I didn't even have money on Coinbase, but the first reset email I got was
from Coinbase. That's definitely the one that hackers are going for immediately when they
SIM swap. Yeah, I don't know why Coinbase still even offers that. Like as soon as SIM swapping
started to become a thing, it was in 2015, I believe, Bitgo had SMS options on our accounts,
and we completely removed them. We said, you know what, no more SMS. And we wrote a blog post about
it. And here we are five years later, and there's still huge companies that are, you know, protecting
money with, you know, accounts that can be reset via SIM swapping. So that is kind of ridiculous.
I can only assume that Coinbase like evaluated the risks versus, I guess, how much trouble it
would be. And they're like, well, you know, we'll have like 0.0 whatever percent of our users get
hacked and lose everything, but everybody else should be fine. So yeah, the exchanges,
security is always a cat and mouse game, right? It's never over. I think even Binance lost like,
what, 4,000 or 40, I think it was 4,000 a coin last year. And the exchanges at least understand
the risks better. And, you know, they keep the vast majority of their funds in cold storage.
So I do believe we're going to continue to see exchanges, hot wallets get hacked. But if,
you know, this is a risk that any exchange needs to take into account and basically have insurance
fund for, right? So you understand that over a long enough timeframe, there's probably going
to be an exploit. And you just want to make sure that that risk is compartmentalized and that
you can essentially pay out on that catastrophe so that none of your users get directly affected.
Yeah, I know it's at the point on Binance, at least for a consumer where like you can have
like an encrypted email, a Proton mail account. And to be able to withdraw funds, you need to,
you know, press your Ubico, use a 2FA code and also do an email code. So that's a lot more than
I remember from before. But like you said, the exchange can still get hacked and your funds can
disappear. So that's just a matter of someone hacking your individual account as opposed to
the exchange itself. I just tweeted out, I think yesterday, maybe the day before, a picture of the
Gox Ubiquis. They were branded for like higher volume traders. And, you know, there were 8,000
or so users who had those. And I don't think the Ubiqui helped them at all when it came down to it.
Right. Because if it's the exchange and that, I mean, yeah, that's from the other side,
unfortunately. So and just to get back to it, like at a very basic level,
what should people be doing sensibly? Is it VPN? Is it to get to a hardware wallet? And
at what point do you have enough, I guess, it's person to person, but accumulated wealth or
accumulated Bitcoin that you really need to start considering multisig? Yeah. So this is the other
tricky thing about security. And it's actually is one of the reasons why we also have a high level
of client services for our premium tiers is because security is not a one size fits all thing. It's
like everybody has their own particular threat model they're worried about, their own family
and friends situation. You know, we have clients who are globetrotters and they don't stay in one
place for more than a month or two. You know, everybody has different variables that have to
go into consideration for their own setup. So it's not possible for me to say, you know,
if you have more than X amount of this, then you need this setup. But rather, the easiest way that
I try to describe it to people is you need to have an order of magnitude more security than you
think you need. And by that, I mean, if you have a thousand dollars in crypto, then you should act
like it's $10,000 and secure it appropriately. If you have a hundred thousand, you should act
like it's a million and so on. And you know, that is going to lead different people to different
conclusions. And the really tough thing about security, especially when we're talking about
like the different loss vectors due to mistakes or natural disaster or whatever, is that I think
people have a hard time doing the like mental math of how likely it actually is. Like
it's the default human condition to say, oh, I'm doing fine now. Nothing's going to happen to me.
And COVID has been a good example of that for people, right? And, you know, and I think, you
know, that is probably why a lot of governments have mandatory insurance requirements. You know,
if you're going to get on the road or whatever, you have to have insurance for these things,
even though it's probably never going to happen to you. They know that it's going to happen to
somebody. And so we can't, you know, we can't mandate insurance. We can't mandate high security
for anyone in the space. All we can hope is that sort of organically over time, the sort of attack
and defense story will continue to force people to understand that if they're not in a good position,
they're going to lose everything. But that's more of a macro perspective. You know, at the
micro perspective, if you end up losing everything, then you're probably not going to get back into
the game, or at least not at any substantial level that you then need the same amount of security
that you needed before, because you're no longer that big of a target. So putting numbers on things
is hard. It's something where you say, I guess, trying to remember the exact saying, but it's
like a penny is worth an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of solution or whatever. I'm sure
I'm screwing that up. But the point being that it's better to put in a little bit of effort
upfront than it is to have a huge catastrophe on your hands. Yeah, it's the old argument is like,
well, why am I going to buy a hundred dollar wallet if I only have $150 in crypto? Because
you believe it's going to be worth 1500, like you said, or 15,000 or 150,000. I'm curious,
after going through all of this, I mean, there's very few people who are doxed in this space,
who are not anonymous. I mean, do you regret not just throwing up an avatar on Twitter and fake
name and going about life that way? No. And the main reason for that is that it allows me to do
in-person events. And while that's been less of an issue this year, I would say I was traveling
and going to various conferences and meetings almost every month when things were still hopping.
I do expect that eventually I will just go completely dark. If I feel that it's mission
accomplished and I don't have much more to contribute, then there's not much point in me
continuing to expose myself. So that is a long-term goal of mine is the final step of privacy
is to really wipe myself off the internet. In fact, like that would have been the easy
thing for me to do after I was attacked is that I could have just deleted all my accounts and shut
up, stop making myself a target. But I took the hard path because I still feel motivated enough
that I need to contribute publicly and I need to use the reputation that I have built over many
years to continue to try to educate people and bring more people into the space because
we're not there yet. The network effect is not yet strong enough that we are going to achieve
world domination. So you're doing it for everyone else. I mean, at the end of the day, it's a public
service. It's pretty cool. I know we touched on Coinbase before and I know we're going to
run out of time pretty soon. But I'm curious as to your take on, you know, the recent controversy
with Brian Armstrong and politics in the workplace because I know that you obviously are self-described
libertarian and that they're kind of the biggest name in this space and it's been big news. So I'm
curious how you feel about it. It's weird, right? Because keeping track of like the
social justice warriors and then the, whatever you want to call them, anti-SJW folks,
I've actually started like getting annoyed by everyone. Basically, anyone who gets triggered
by stuff. It was like, there are better ways to go about trying to achieve your goals. And
admittedly, I say a lot of things that trigger a lot of people too, but that's also just kind of
like my marketing goal is, you know, that's how you get engagement, right? Is that you say and do
controversial things. And, you know, from a company perspective, because, you know, I've been running
a company for several years now, I completely understand Brian's point that he doesn't want
people, you know, wasting cycles, arguing about politics when they could be working on Coinbase
goals or whatever. At Casa, we don't have anything like that. I mean, we have a chat room called
random where you're free to put whatever the hell you want in there, but we have not really had
anything devolve into, you know, political arguments or anything. So, I haven't directly
had to deal with that. Of course, we're a much, much smaller company and I'm sure not as diverse
as Coinbase. So, ultimately, it's up to the executives of any company to decide because,
you know, they are at the top of the pyramid. This is a hierarchical command and control
structure within traditional companies. So, you know, he's the dictator, like it or not,
he gets to decide what people do because he's the one paying them. I don't think it's like
a freedom of speech issue or whatever because this is a voluntary agreement between the employees
and the employers. And at any time, an employer can say, you know, if you don't agree to these
conditions, you know, at least in America, most states are at will employment and you can get
terminated for a select few reasons. So, I felt that, you know, his, what is it, four to six months
of severance and like seven-year option exercise was extremely generous from that standpoint.
And I was actually more surprised that only 5% of people took it. But on the flip side,
perhaps people feel, some of the employees there may feel incentivized to stay on because,
you know, Coinbase is pretty obviously going to IPO soon. And so there might be a huge payoff for
them to just shut up and go with the flow until they can exit.
So on the one hand, there's my beliefs, but that on the other hand, that heavy scale of future
earnings, basically. So last question, do you have any idea or ideas who Satoshi is?
There have been so many theories over the years. There's no concrete ones that I land on. I am
a hundred percent convinced that it's not Craig Wright. And I've written extensively on that point.
But, you know, I've heard theories, everything from, it was an elderly woman at the NSA to,
it was some like Asian teenager whiz kid. Personally, my favorite and what I hope is that
it's actually an AI from the future that sent itself back to, you know, create its own
monetary system that it'll use to take over the world when the time is right.
Skynet.
But, you know, I don't really care, of course, who Satoshi is. I do care about Satoshi's
motivations. And so I have been doing some more research over the past year into the
Patoshi pattern and early possible Satoshi mining stuff. I do find that interesting if
you've been reading any of Sergio Lerner's writings. It's a really technical stuff. But
what it seems to be pointing to is more and more evidence that Satoshi's early mining was not done
out of greed, but was in fact done just to keep the Bitcoin network alive as it was bootstrapping.
There's actually reason to believe that Satoshi mined purposefully slower than they could
have. And they were just trying to keep the heartbeat of blocks going at a fairly predictable
pace until enough other miners came on board and then they slowly ramped down their own
and then they slowly ramped down their own hash power. So that I think that that is interesting
because it provides some evidence that perhaps Satoshi is not planning on spending those early
Bitcoin. Whether or not they kept them, who knows. But it seems like they certainly were not in it
to try to enrich themselves.
It would be nice to believe that actually believed everything in the white paper and
was more of an altruistic earth shattering technology than a get rich quick scheme.
Certainly. So where can everybody follow you guys, check out what CASA is doing most importantly,
and consider your services and follow you personally after this?
Yeah, you can learn all about CASA at keys.casa. It's keys.casa. And on Twitter, I'm lop l-o-p-p
and CASA's Twitter is CASA HODL.
Yeah, dude, having a four letter Twitter name is epic. There's like value. There's a lot of value
in that. I wish I got in early on the Twitter game too, but I haven't gotten any tokens from that.
I think I was ahead of Bitcoin on Twitter, actually. I think I was like 2008 or 2009 on
Twitter. It's crazy that it's been that long. Well, thank you, man, so much. I really appreciate
it. I think there's a lot of really good information here that people hopefully will take seriously
and start to consider privacy and security. Because I still think that most people don't.
I think they just think it's like their Schwab account or something, and they're just going to
buy a little Bitcoin and whatever. And even beyond crypto, just protecting yourself. Unfortunately,
yes. This is the privacy versus convenience issue where we seem to be trending towards
convenience and away from privacy. So it's more work, but I honestly believe that putting the
work in upfront is going to pay off over the long run. Awesome, man. Well, I hope you don't
go completely dark before we get to have a follow-up conversation down the road. Thanks again for being
here. Thanks.

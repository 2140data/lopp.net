Okay, it looks like we're live perfect. Okay, thank you all for joining us today. I'm Jessica
Lavec. I'm the executive director at C4. And today, we're really excited to talk about the
cryptocurrency security standard. And we have our steering committee here with us today.
So let's start by going around and introducing ourselves. So first up, let's go with Josh up in
the corner. Hey, Josh Madugo here with C4 proud board member, one of the co authors of the original
CCSS, and currently working at slow ninja. Thank you. All right, Dirk. Hi, sorry. I'm Dirk Anderson
here. And I am also the one of the board or one of the committee members here and also on the
certified Bitcoin professional committee, and currently the CIO CTO at salt lemon.
Thank you. Michael. Hi, everyone. My name is Michael Perklin. I'm proud to be one of the
founders and see for and one of the founding members that wrote the initial drafts of the
CCSS. After spending a five year stint at shape shift us, I'm now a proud member of the decentralized
shape shift down where I work to keep everything decentralized. Thank you, Ron. Thank you, Jessica.
My name is Ron Stoner. I am a committee member, the architect of the CCSS auditor exam and the
head of security over at Casa. Awesome. All right. And now Petri, our committee chair,
you introduce yourself, please. Thanks, Jessica. So my background is finance and
IT. So chartered accountants, CISA, and then six certificates in IT. And I used to be previous at
KPMG at the moment trying hash data, which is data aggregation and organization. And then also
consulting with quite a few firms in the space. Thank you. Noah. Hey, everybody. I'm Noah Buxton.
I'm a partner at Arminino. Arminino is a top 20 public accounting firm, and I get to lead our
blockchain and digital assets industry practice. My background is actually in IT and controls
assurance that started our risk assurance practice here at the firm before I got the crypto bug. And
I get to do crypto full time all the time now. So I'm a happy guy. Love it. And Jameson.
Hi, I'm the CTO of Casa. I was probably one of the first people to take the certified Bitcoin
professional exam in early 2014 and had that on my resume when I then went full time Bitcoin and
joined BitGo, which was one of the founding members about a year later, which resulted in me
getting even deeper into the standard over the coming years. And it's been great to be a part of
the committee for the past few years. Awesome. And Andreas Antonopoulos is also a committee member,
but he unfortunately was unable to make it to the call today, but he probably says hello to
everyone. So thank you all for being here. Really appreciate it. I'm excited to talk about the
CCSS. So it's the Cryptocurrency Security Standard. It has been around for a while and I'm excited
for Michael Perklin, one of the founders, to start explaining what that is. So Michael, will you jump
in? Thanks, Jessica. Yeah, it's been a long road. C4 launched in May 2014. And very shortly after,
we began work on the CCSS. At the time in 2014, I was working full time as a blockchain security
expert, or I guess back then it was a Bitcoin security expert, because there really was only
Bitcoin at the time. And historically, whenever I would do security audits in the traditional world,
I would audit against a set of standards, maybe the ISO 27001 or SOC 2, or I would always audit
against some standard. And it would be very easy to tell a client, hey, you're not, you're not
meeting the bar because these three controls are not present in your system. Oh, and it came to
cryptocurrency systems. At the time, only a few years before, sorry, only a few months before,
Mt. Gox was hacked, losing countless funds. And it seemed very clear that every company was going
their own way. Every company was implementing whatever security controls they thought was good
for them. But nobody was adhering to any kind of common standard. And it occurred to C4 that
somebody should have a standard that outlines all the security controls that are necessary
to properly protect cryptocurrency. And if nobody else is going to be building the standard,
why not the one at C4? So work began on the CCSS in June 2014.
Through a collaboration of a lot of different companies, including BitGo,
where Jameson's involvement came from, as well as a variety of other exchanges, whose CTOs or CISOs
offered to provide feedback on the initial draft. This all culminated in the launch of the CCSS
in January 2015, at the very first Satoshi roundtable. Satoshi was the first company
at the very first Satoshi roundtable. Since then, the CCSS has been referenced by many different
companies on their websites, proclaiming to adhere to the standard, as well as countries,
governments, a variety of countries have required that their financial services adhere to the CCSS
standard, if they're going to be getting involved in cryptocurrency. This long road of the CCSS
has led us here today, where we only just a few days ago launched the CCSSA, the auditor exam,
which certifies a person and their individual knowledge of the CCSS, making them a proper
candidate for securing your business with their knowledge. And did I miss anything, Jessica?
I think that was a good overview. Does anybody else on the committee want to say anything about
the CCSS in general, before we get into some of the specifics of it?
Yeah, I will just add that a lot of these things that we're going to jump in with these specifics
were actually modeled after real world behavior, right? So when you look at some of the traditional
and historical hacks and things that have happened in this industry, a lot of the specifics that
we're going to discuss are directly applicable to those events or the lack of security that
allowed some of those things to transpire. So this is a battle test in, and it's based off
real world scenarios. This isn't just stuff that we're coming up with because it sounds nice. These
are applicable controls that can be applied to help secure those cryptocurrency based information
systems. That's a great point, Ron. The initial committee that put together the first set of
controls for the CCSS, we did so by analyzing every single hack that had occurred so far from
the beginning of Bitcoin all the way through 2014. And that is where all the controls come from.
That's a great point, Ron. Well, and it's interesting that people have said that they've
looked at the standard and said specifically like, oh, this is maybe why this came into play,
because they remember some of that. So yeah, go ahead, Dirk. Yeah, I would just add to that,
too. One of the things that I think is really interesting about the CCSS is that it is kind
of a modular security compliance set of controls. So it's not intending to replace ISO 27,000 or
NIST or PCI or anything else like that. It is a very specific set of controls around handling
cryptocurrency or digital assets. And as such can just kind of be plugged in alongside of any other
sort of like controls framework or anything you might be using for security overall in an organization.
Yeah, that's a good point. I might just say that I think everybody on this call,
many of them Bitcoin OGs, right, definitely believe in decentralization. We believe in
sovereign money and self-custody, but we also acknowledge that this marketplace,
it has become a capital markets marketplace, right? And it needs on-ramps and off-ramps.
There will continue to be service providers and centralized players that allow ready access
for anything from retail to institutions to get into this space. And if that's going to be the
case, this market needs the proper infrastructure of trust and transparency and a focused security
standard that deals with actually custody of cryptographic private keys related to cryptos
is 100% necessary. So this is a really exciting thing, I think, for the larger marketplace.
Yeah, for sure. Without going into details, it feels especially pertinent this week with
some of the things that have been going on. So let's talk a little bit about what the standard
is. So Petri, do you want to get in there and talk a little bit about how it's structured with
the categories and aspect controls and what that looks like? And someone from our team will put
the link to the standard in the YouTube chat. Definitely. So, I mean, firstly, PassWolf Turon,
who sort of authored this and wrote a lot of it. And as we've mentioned, a lot of this is very
practical. So, I mean, at a very high level, we've got two main categories, the cryptographic asset
management and then the operations side of it. The cryptographic key management is really focused
on those keys that are you're using. So over there, we're going into key MC generation,
wallet creation, key storage, key usage, key compromise, keyholder grant revoke. So,
as Dirk mentioned, Noah, you've got standards out there already. But I remember when I actually did
some of these audits, you in a SOC 2 in the ISO world, it's very difficult. Those standards don't
provide for the cryptographic or the private key specific type controls. So that's where this is
really useful. You can actually get into the details and have a standard to test against.
And then the operations side, you go into security testing and audits, data sanitization,
proof of reserve and audit logs. So those are more of the operational controls that you're
expecting to see around these keys. And then I think one of the things that's very useful
for those of you when you're looking at the table is you'll also see the rationale
behind these controls. Because I mean, the cryptocurrency industry is always evolving,
people find better ways to do things. And that's where that rationale is really useful. You can see
what the principle is that we're trying to achieve to, for example, ensure that software hasn't been
modified when it's being used. And for an auditor, that's really useful. So sometimes you might not
meet the control to the letter, but you know what the principle is that you're trying to actually
achieve there. And I think for any auditor, that's actually really useful when you're doing these
audits. Now, in terms of scoping, in terms of all the controls, I think there's going to always be
questions around that. And that's where we definitely welcome anyone's input and questions around
this. We've already had a lot of community members asking questions, helping us to strengthen this.
I think that's almost where the decentralized aspect comes into this. We want everyone to be
helping to build the standard. So it's not just this group of the steering committee,
it's everyone's input, and we're busy building it out. I mean, we've already made a few updates,
as I think Michael said, when this was originally designed, this was almost a Bitcoin security
standard, because that was the gold standard back then. But we have made a few updates already
to be able to accommodate other technologies and other tokens as well.
One of the interesting things about the list of the aspects and controls that Petri listed,
that make up the CCSS, is the fact that each group focuses on a different area of an information
system. Now, most people think of an information system as, oh, the computer that you're using.
But when you're instituting a system at a company, yes, the computer, the hardware is one piece of
that information system, but the software that's running on the hardware is another piece. The
humans that interact with the system is another piece, and the policies and procedures that they
follow as well. So there's actually five different aspects of a information system, hardware,
software, policies, procedures, and the education of the personnel who are interacting. So the
CCSS dives into the lifecycle of all of those moving parts. How does a key get created? How is
it born? How does it live? How does it die? When it comes to the people, how are they initially
granted access to the system, and when are they revoked access in the end? The entire lifecycle
of all five of those components, whether they be the hardware, software, policy, procedure, or
education, are covered in the CCSS. And that's why I think it really makes a very tight,
holistic security for any information system. Yeah, Ron, did you want to jump in and talk a
little bit about it as well? I was just going to add to Michael's point, there's some other things
that this standard goes into that we see in cryptocurrency-based information systems that
I've never seen a lot of guidance about, and that's some of the caveat information about
things like dust transactions, right? If you're doing reporting and accounting, or you have
potential denial of service scenarios that could occur there, the standard actually encompasses a
lot of that. What do we do for things like reorgs or forks where we're changing the chain tip,
where we've got two different copies of chains out there? These are things where the standard's
trying to provide some guidance and some controls to make sure these systems are being architected
these systems are being architected correctly and securely to prevent a lot of the issues that
we're seeing today, right? A PCI audit, a SOC audit, some of the ones we've mentioned earlier,
they may not catch the fact that private key information is being stored in clear tech somewhere.
This is the type of standard I think that fills in those gaps and really takes a deep dive into
all of those creation and usage and storage methodologies to ensure things are being done
correctly. Yeah, and I think as we're talking about it, we'll start to get into some of
the specifics and the details of the standard. So there are two categories. There's the cryptographic
asset management, and then there's the operation side of it. And if you look at the matrix,
you'll see those two separate categories. But then within it, there are a lot of aspects. And
we tried to add rationales as well to the standard, which explains why this is something
that matters and gives a little bit more information for either an entity that's
cryptocurrency system is being audited or the auditor that's actually going in and looking at
these systems as well. If you have questions about any of the parts of the standard, feel
free to put them in the chat either in Twitter or on YouTube, and we'll do our best to answer
those as well. I think it's interesting to talk a little bit about what some of the
aspects are requirements that maybe are a little bit unique to cryptocurrency. I mean, obviously,
this entire standard is specifically about cryptocurrency, but there are some pieces that
I think people have had questions about in particular. And I'm sorry to call you out,
Michael, on this, but I know that you've answered this for me before, but the proof of reserve
section, would you be able to speak a little bit on that in particular?
Yeah, absolutely. It's occurred numerous times in the past where a exchange or some company that
is taking custody of a lot of different cryptocurrencies, they actually don't have as
much as they report that they do. Or in other words, the reserves of cryptocurrency assets
that they control does not match what they are telling the public. This is usually a sign of
either some kind of an exploit or some kind of fraud. Either way, it's something that every
user of the system needs to be aware of when it's happening. So the proof of reserve requirement of
the CCSS allows the auditor or it provides a check for the auditor to perform to make sure that all
of the assets that the company claims to be able to control really are controllable by that company
and no funds have gone missing. Great. Thank you for explaining that. Josh?
Yeah, as far as the topic of what makes the CCSS unique to other standards. And again,
the whole design is to complement other standards specifically for this purpose. And the one main
thing that comes out is there's no undo in cryptocurrency and blockchains and things like
that. So a lot of the standard came of the fact that although it's one thing to lose data and
certainly we see businesses losing customer data all the time and not that that's a good thing,
but they don't ever actually lose the data. They give the data away. Someone else has a copy of
the data, but they also still have the data themselves unless there's been some sort of
destruction. But when these assets are stolen, when digital assets are gone, they're actually
gone. So a lot of the standard is putting in, you know, extra controls in place to make sure
that there's a very, very one strict audit trail to know what has happened and who has happened by
as well as to prevent things from happening either accidentally or maliciously.
That point dovetails actually to what Michael was just saying around proof of reserves. I mean,
this is an area that you guys are going to have to stop me talking about because it's a passion
area for me, but it's, you know, from Greg Maxwell's early, you know, 2014 theory around
proof of reserves to what we have today is a wide disparity of practice. And as Michael noted,
there seems to be this unwritten rule, right? I think docs had the unwritten rule early. They
operated under reserved when their hack was not disclosed for some time, but essentially the
unwritten rule in our industry from the exchange perspective is that, yeah, you deposit Bitcoin,
that Bitcoin might be in an omnibus or shared wallet at the exchange, but largely it's going
to be a one-to-one reserve to what the exchange owes you. But this is a really important area
where CCSS is including this as a baseline best practice and requirement to the extent that we
start to see this required through the audit process. It's going to force best practice.
It's going to force uniformity at these exchanges, right? There's really no service provider that
shouldn't be able to provide this level of access essentially or transparency to their customers,
right? And historically it's been the case that exchanges will, they'll lean on security actually
as the reason that they shouldn't do this, or they'll, you know, say that that potentially
could expose them to a vulnerability. But that's, that thankfully is in the review mirror. We've
done it, right? Kraken has done a $19 billion proof of reserves against Bitcoin and Ether and
others are starting to adopt. So anyway, not to take the proof of reserves tangent, but that is
a really cool nugget that's within the CCSS, but that has a larger impact on the way these
platforms treat their customers and provide information to the larger market. So.
I think one thing maybe to add on there that was a very interesting point is we, a while back we
got the question of why do you have a proof of reserves? This is a security standard. Why do you
do that? And I think it's important to build that link between the security controls and those
private keys and the assets, because you don't want to have perfect security, but the assets
aren't actually even linked to those assets. So I think this actually builds that link when we're
doing an audit. Yeah, absolutely. Does anyone else want to touch on any of the specific
aspects right now before we move into talking about the levels? Was there anything else anyone
wanted to point out? You're just like, can't wait to talk about, cause it's so fun. I feel like
I think we're super nerdy, but it is super fun to think about this and to spend time focusing on how
to make this industry, this field, this space that we all really care about safer, not just for
ourselves, but for the people that we know who are trying to get into crypto and aren't sure how to
do it or where to go and having something that says, yes, this is a secure place to have your
crypto be held. Even if they're just holding it for a minute while you're doing a bridge,
something like that, I think it really matters. So Dirk, did you want to jump in and talk about
the different levels of the CCSS? So to explain that the CCSS is the standard, the CCSSA is the
auditor, and there's an exam for that. And entities, cryptocurrency systems are certified at
different levels and they are all secure. But Dirk, do you want to explain what the differences are
for us? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So the way that each one of the controls is set up in the standard,
there are three different levels or up to three different levels of requirements for that particular
control. And there are some controls that maybe only have one or two. And it might be that there
is like to be, so it's level one, two, and three, level one being the baseline, level three being
kind of the more paranoid, secure. And there might be, for example, nothing in level one,
right? That this control really is about like kind of that enhanced security. It might also be that
there is nothing in level three, because this control is really just like, there's a baseline,
and you just got to meet that baseline, period, right? There is no, there's no other stuff. It's
just, you've got to be doing this, period. But then there are some controls as well that have like
different requirements in each one of the controls. A good example of that is, I think it's 131.03.03,
which is one of the controls around backing up your, your seeds. And the first one basically
just says you have to have environmental, protection against environmental control, right?
So you don't want to flood or something like that to, you know, destroy your ability to access your
keys or your key backups. The second level is, what does it add on to that? Oh, that they have
to be stored geographically separate, right? So that they're not, all your key backups aren't in
the same place as you're operating every day. So that, so that you can actually go get them if there
is a flood or something like that. And then the last one actually takes into account, like
electromagnetic attacks and that sort of thing, right? So if you're storing them only on a digital
electronic magnetic format, right? They're susceptible to a remote, like you have AMF type
poles, whether that's sunspots or intentional, right? So, so that's kind of an example of the
progression of the different levels. And so each one of the questions has those. And, and in a lot
of cases, right? So the organization I worked for was one of the early folks to actually go through
the audit process. And we found that there were a couple where we were just like, you know what,
from a business perspective, the way that we do business, it doesn't make sense for us to
try and be a three or even a two, right? We're, you know, we're, we're doing the baseline level
of things here in that particular control to protect the data. But because of the way that
we do business or because of the business we're in, you know, it might not make sense to do some of
those others. So there's the, the, the standard was designed not to be a one size fits all
necessarily, but to be a one standard is useful for all sort of approach. And so, yeah, so that's
the, there's each of those. And the only other thing I'll add then is right, that the overall,
you get an overall kind of rating that also falls into that one, two, three, which is the whole,
maybe is only as fast as the slowest ship, right? So the, you know, if you have, if all of your
scores are up to twos and threes, right, but you have a couple areas where you don't have a three,
then your overall score for the CCSS is going to be a two. If you have, you know, one category,
a single category that you're only a one in overall score is going to be a one. But what I
always try to stress there is that one is good, solid baseline security, right? The whole idea
of being a level one is you're doing the stuff you should be doing. The level twos and the level
threes are, Hey, you know what you're doing, the stuff you're, you should be doing, but also
you're doing a hundred billion dollars, you know, in, in transactions, you know, a day or a month,
or maybe you should up your, you know, up your game a little bit, right? So that the idea being
that there's, there's options there, depending on what fits the, the risk factors associated
with your business. That's awesome. That's a great point there, Dirk. Yeah. The, the overall
levels that Dirk was just mentioning, I think is super important to stress because it's actually
one of the most commonly misunderstood pieces of the CCSS. When you look at any information
system's ability to reach level one or level two or level three, naturally you think, well,
level three has got to be the best. So I've got to strive for the best. The reality is level one is
secure. Most information systems out there, I would be willing to wager, do not even meet level
one. It takes a considerable effort to reach level one compliance with the CCSS. And if your
organization has reached level one, that is a huge accomplishment. Level two and level three are even
more secure and are paranoid secure. And truth be told, that paranoid level of security, while it
does maximize the confidentiality or the integrity or the availability of, of your assets, it's,
it'll probably also be so onerous on your staff to use that information system while maintaining
such a high degree of security that it may actually slow you down. A perfect example is the one that
that Dirk gave. You want your keys to be secure against environmental issues. As long as it's
secure against fire and flood, that is secure enough. And that is a level one compliance.
Your keys will not be burned. Your keys will not be flooded off of a piece of paper. But you can
but you can also go farther beyond that. You can spread them out over multiple geographic areas,
and you can protect them against an electromagnetic pulse. Now, how rare and how infrequent are
electromagnetic pulses? But they are still technically a risk, and it could wipe a USB
flash drive without your knowledge or intent. So that's why level three is the paranoid level.
But level one is still an incredible achievement and should not be discounted as being insecure.
Yeah, and I think that's the thing, right? There's a good number of us on this call came out of
backgrounds in pre blockchain pre crypto information security, right? So we come,
we came at this from a risk based perspective, right, trying to make this a risk based standard.
And so that the controls that you can implement and put into place are appropriate from a cost
perspective from a management and oversight perspective to the business you're doing. And
and it just doesn't, you know, doesn't always make sense, right? And it may be that you're doing,
you know, kind of ephemeral transactions, and you can literally expose the secrets or the keys
to your private wallets after you've done them, because that wallet never gets used anymore,
right? I mean, in theory, right, that you could have that kind of a risk profile.
But that for the moments as long as the data is sitting on a wall that you absolutely have
to have the backups, right? So it's not always just necessarily even what we think of, you know,
from a confidentiality trumps everything else sort of perspective, right? So the design of
the whole structure was allowed to just let people apply it as it made sense in their in their
business or operations. So this is a question that comes from the chat that relates to what
we're talking about with the different levels. The question is, what is an example of a data
sanitization policy failure? And that's 2.02 for the aspect objective. But it goes up in level,
obviously, of what is the most secure way, but can someone explain what a failure of proper data
data sanitization would look like? And then we can go into the levels as well. Michael?
Sure, I'll start off. Yeah, I I'm going based on on memory here. But I believe that one specific
control it works as a binary on or off you either have sanitized your data, or you have not sanitized
your data. There is there are no multiple levels of sanitization that that you can achieve for that
level. There is actually that was one of the updates. There's two in that case, I'm going
to turn it over to one of the other committee members who is more familiar with that one control.
I'm actually glad you brought that up, though, because I feel like what you just said, you've
looked at this so much, but it's a good reminder that the standard is huge. And it's all encompassing.
And you can't just like memorize it and just know it, which is why it exists like a two different
formats on our website. And it's living and breathing and changing. Exactly. I feel like
that was such a good example of how we do change it as needed. So oddly, that was a really effective
way to prove that. So thank you. Ron, do you want to explain the different levels? I see you unmuted.
Yeah. So I think what Michael's actually referring to is the level one control where
he's talking about the binary option of does your staff have the tools and the knowledge to perform
data sanitization. And what we're really talking about here is think about the hard drives that
people are putting data on, right? Where they're storing keys and things like that, or the backups
that Burke's talking about. We've seen through history where those drives get mailed off,
or people forget they're in the storage room, or it goes to the landfill. And hackers,
much like myself, are going, this has some really good information on it, right? So
corporations that are taking and information systems that are taking their security seriously
are implementing this DSP, this data sanitization policy. So for level one, if you're implementing
that in your organization or your system or whatever you're looking at complying with these
different types of controls, the level one is just to say, do we have people on staff that's aware of
this, how to do it, and operating in that procedure? Level two goes a little bit further. As we said,
level one's great. You're wiping that data. You're ensuring those CD-ROMs, those USB drives,
and whatever you're doing to store your information and your data, you're taking
procedures and steps to wipe it. Level two goes a little bit further, where it actually has a
policy that details all of that. So just like policies at work and stuff like that, sometimes
there's the unspoken policy, but when the rubber meets the road, is there a document that lists
who's responsible for this? How often are they doing it? Have they been trained in it? We're
really wanting to see a policy that details all of that. And then when level three, we're going a
step further. We have level one with the people that know how to do it. Level two, we have a
policy that defines who's doing it. Now at level three, we have an audit trail of all of those
actions that are being taken to wipe that media or perform data sanitization. So as you're seeing
with that hierarchical structure there, we're getting a little bit better at each level. And
as Dirk said, level one is nothing to laugh at. I would feel comfortable if somebody told me,
we wipe our data, we use this tool, this is the person responsible. No, it's not written in a
policy, but we'll get there. We'll get to level two eventually. We know we can do a little bit
better to help close those gaps and ensure the system's working as optimized and efficiently
as it can be. Yeah, a clear failure would just be like that record-keeping requirement. You see
that there's an in-scope system that doesn't... You've missed a day, essentially. You've missed
a week. Whatever the cycle is that's defined by the policy, the auditor goes to sample that.
And if you find it, that would be a potential failure of the controller, an exception to that
control. Yeah, and I think as we talked a little bit about how this is updated as needed within the
standard and then the exam as well will be updated to reflect that. And we will continue to do
live streams or information sharing about these specific aspects. So if everything... I know there
are questions popping up in the chat, everything that we haven't covered yet, we probably won't
get to everything today, but we will do more of these to share information. And we're also
going to release a video of Ron and Petri that are there explaining some of the controls as well
in another video, which will be released probably next week. So I feel like this is a good start to
explain what the standard is about and what it represents and what is inside of the standard
when you look at it. But why don't we talk a little bit about why it matters? So Jameson,
do you want to talk about... You said a little bit about how you started working at Bicco and how you
then realized how important something like this is, but can you explain why you think the CCSS
matters? Sure. It exists for the same reason that other widely used standards are in existence and
have been compiled. It's because we're in a space where if you make a mistake, if you overlook
something, there's potentially disastrous consequences. And I think most of us here have
been in this ecosystem for quite a while. It is a very new ecosystem. I mean, only really about a
decade from an industry perspective of professional quote unquote businesses that are taking custody
of people's cryptographic assets and private keys and managing them and whatnot. And so obviously,
when you have a new system, it's the same type of ongoing war that we see with any type of security.
It's a constant battle of attack versus defense. And people on both sides of that are constantly
learning as the other side is trying new things. I think over the past decade, we've seen over a
hundred high profile hacks of custodians where private keys were exfiltrated, massive amounts
of money were lost. And if each failure doesn't result in the rest of the ecosystem learning,
then we're going to have a really bad time getting this technology to be mainstream,
because people are not going to be comfortable with it. It's going to seem like it's just too
unsafe for people to even deal with. So there's a reputation issue. It's a knowledge sharing issue.
There's no good reason why large amounts of money should be lost from different entities in the
exact same way, because we have the ability to coordinate, to create these best practices and
standards from the mistakes and failures of the past and continue ratcheting up the overall
security of the entire industry. Now, one of the big problems I would say with crypto in general is
that self-custody is not as widespread as we would probably like to see. The default way that almost
everybody gets into this ecosystem is through a custodial provider. So it's incredibly important
that whatever your default setup is, is also fairly secure. Once again, getting back to the
reputation and people feeling comfortable using these technologies. So why is it tricky? Well,
prior to having a standard, you really had to go by gut feeling, by the history of any given provider.
So when I think back to early days when I was on MTGox, that was the first exchange I ever used.
Even then, I was a fairly technical guy. I was a web developer. I was familiar with best practices
for general web development. And I could see that MTGox as a service was kind of rough around the
edges. There were some red flags that made me a little nervous trusting them with a lot of money.
But for a less sophisticated, less technical person, they would probably miss most of that stuff.
And you really had no idea what was going on behind the scenes. These custodians tend to be
black boxes. And so in order to get an idea about their reputation, you're really limited to what
you can do with you interacting with them or trying to watch them interact with other people.
So what we're doing here is we're creating a trustworthy mechanism for people to more
quantitatively judge the security of various entities in the ecosystem. And of course,
we do that by having the organization of CCSS, which is managing the standard, managing the
auditor exam, and basically us putting our reputation out there saying, these people
understand the standard and we have made sure that they know what their controls are. And from there,
they can use that reputation to then attest that they have checked that company XYZ meets
a certain threshold. So I see this as a sort of way of uplifting a large part of the industry
by leveraging our collective experience and reputation and letting the rest of the industry
improve their standing. Rather than them just saying, yes, we're secure, they can say,
yes, we have a level of security that is recognized by many reputable people and entities
throughout this ecosystem that we are following the best practices, at least the best practices
as they are known today. Like we said, this is going to be a continuously evolving thing.
Yeah, that was a great rundown of it. I think a couple other people wanted to jump in too.
I saw on mute her hands up. Michael, I think you were one. Josh, Josh, do you want to start?
I only reacted with this emoji because I agree with everything Jameson said.
I thought it was a hand, but you can't see it on you too, but it was an applause. He's very excited,
which I am too. I think that was a great way of explaining why I said that.
Josh, do you want to add some more? Yeah, I just wanted to add. Obviously that business to customer
thing is really important because it's all of us, it's all new people joining the industry and
getting involved and we want to make sure that there's ways that they can see those red flags
or see someone who might be trustable in the space. But I think there's also a really important
business to business component that we want to make sure that there's a way that we can
make sure that there's a really important business to business component about what the CCSS allows
for. One of those main kind of situations, let's say either an insurer coming into a business
and really needing to know, does this business and really needing to know...
Sorry, things got exciting in the car. Business to business aspects of being able to know
when an insurer can trust a business or understanding what policies can apply to that business.
Having other reputable firms in the industry who normally do security assessments giving them the
tools so that way they can go in and understand, oh, I'm dealing with a cryptocurrency company.
There's other things I should be looking for as well before I give my approval on this business
as well. Or even businesses merging and doing due diligence and things like that too and understanding
what is this bicycle that I'm buying? Is it actually going to work down the street or is
it all kind of spoken here? I think obviously protecting customers is massive and obviously
I think that's our core desire is to make sure that the normal users of the space are protected,
but helping businesses interact with each other I think is a really,
really valuable step to helping the industry as a whole mature as well.
Maybe something to add is one of the things I always think about is the old principle of
trust, the verify. And in this industry, a lot of us are trusting at the moment,
but the verify is very hard. I mean, a custodian can't open up their doors for everyone to come
and check. So by having a standard, by having CCSSAs out there who can actually verify this,
it opens up the entire industry and it helps you to be able to trust to say, yes,
someone has actually gone in here and checked that they're doing all of the stuff that they
say on the website that they're doing. I think it's so important too, because
people who aren't super technical and are end users need other people who are trusted,
who are able to actually evaluate these things to go in and take a look at it and to have that
system of checks and balances if you're unable to do that yourself. So the standard I think is
going to, it already has changed the industry in my opinion, and it will more so as we continue
to get people certified as auditors and get entities, cryptocurrency systems certified at
the different levels as well. Noah, did you want to add to that? CISOs and CTOs love standards and
frameworks and methodologies that they can easily communicate. The board level, they need to
communicate to the board level of companies and key investors that they're doing the right things,
but technical gibberish doesn't work for that, even though it might be all of the right things.
So these kinds of things where you can say, yeah, we're following a focused security standard that's
directly related to how we secure custodial crypto and digital assets. That's the kind of thing that
goes upward very effectively and also trickles downward through the organization very effectively
as well. This is a way for CISOs and CTOs, they should be welcoming this with open arms. I know
many are, because you can drive a policy and activity across the team in a very sort of
uniform and known way. It's not just because the CTO has a great idea. It's no, we're following
the standards, right? And this is our roadmap. And I would add just on top of that, and kind of to
that value question we talked earlier about maybe you only do something at a level one, and even
though everything else is at a two and three, so overall you're maybe at a level one, but there's
still value in that, right? There's still value in the standard, even if you can't be validated
against it. There are businesses that the way that they operate, that they're not going to validate
against the entire CCSS standard, right? Maybe they use a third party custodian for some of their
assets or something, right? There may be situations in business environments where people or
organizations are not going to validate against the entire standard. Absolutely doesn't deplete
the use exactly for the reasons that Noah was talking about, that the standards still can
bring value, right? You can still use it as a tool in your environment and just say, okay,
these are the five questions or the five sections of the CCSS that really apply to what we're doing
and how we're doing it. Let's make sure that we're aligned to those. So it can still be a partial
alignment type tool. And maybe the other questions apply to that third party custodian you're using
or something, and you use those to evaluate who's going to be doing that for you. So even when it's
not about necessarily validating against the entire standard, there's still a lot of value there,
but it can bring your organization. Yeah. And personally too, I mean, I know I've looked at
the standard compared to what I've done with the assets I hold. So yeah, I think that's a really
good point. I do also want to point out, this is a question somebody had in the chat about how you
know if an entity has had their system audited. And so we will be sharing with that, that entity
will get a badge that says that they have been audited and there's going to be a number on
their badge that shows what level they are certified as. And then also it will be on our
website. So if you hear that an entity has gone through the audit and they're saying they're
level three at this point, that means that they have self-audited. So as of August 4th,
it does not mean that they have officially been certified by C4. It means that they looked at it
and determined themselves what level they were at. And that is very different than having an
external party come in and look at what's going on and really evaluate the entire standard. And
we have a couple of audits that actually have already started. And from what I've heard,
the companies are surprised at how kind of difficult it is to be able to get certified
at level one. Yeah, I saw Michael, your finger went up. Yep. It's even level one is a challenge.
That's a great point, Jessica, about the difference between compliance and certification.
The CCSS has been released in the wild since January 2015. Many companies, many governments
have referenced the standard and have used it for self-audits and determining whether or not they're
compliant with the standard. But up until August 3rd, nobody has been certified with that compliance.
And now that we finally have a set of certified auditors, I'm excited to see how many of these
companies that have been working with the CCSS for so long, how many will choose to go through
and audit by one of the certified auditors so that they can display that badge proudly
on their website and have C4 list them as a certified information system?
I did just want to clarify real quickly with what Jessica said that C4 is not actually a
certifying body, right? We're not certifying that people are compliant as an organization.
We're training auditor, we're developing the standard, training people on the standard,
certifying auditors against their knowledge of the standard to go out and audit.
And then we maintain a record source for verification that that has happened. So that
a certified auditor has gone out and done the audit and validated them at a particular level.
But that C4 is not, because that kind of goes against kind of the, I mean, it's way too
centralized for the folks on this call, right? To do that, right? That's not the goal to make
ourselves the authority on that, right? We're providing tools so that this can happen,
but not trying to be a certifying body, unlike, say, PTI Security Council or something like that.
Yeah, that's a good point. We're relying on the auditors to go in and do the audits.
That leads us into talking about how to become an auditor. Josh,
do you want to talk about what it looks like to become a CCSSA?
Sure. So, as with all of our certifications, the Certified Bitcoin Professional, Certified Ethereum
Professional, now we have the Cryptocurrency Security Standard Auditor certification. So it's a
100-question exam that has about 90 minutes to take the exam. You sign up through our site
and take the exam. This one, it'll have kind of two main sections of information. One is going to
be just a general understanding of the standard itself, of the Cryptocurrency Security Standard.
Also, how you apply the Cryptocurrency Security Standard while auditing a business.
Beyond that, though, there's also four different scenarios that you'll want to study.
These are each different organizations with different controls and details.
I really recommend, if you're going to do the CCSSA exam, you might want to actually not only
print those out and have them handy, but me personally, when I took the exam, I did a CCSSA
assessment. I took out my checklist and I did an assessment on each of those. So that way, I knew
kind of where they sat at each going into that exam. When I went into that exam, I could just
reference my assessment to easily answer each of those questions. So that way, I knew where
reference my assessment to easily answer those questions. There's a little bit of, I would say,
cheat code, but really it's just being prepared. If you want to really kick that test butt,
I would highly recommend, and I mean, it's really just good practice to do a CCSS assessment,
grab the checklist. One thing that we haven't actually mentioned, but I think it's a pretty
important piece of information, the CCSS, the Cryptocurrency Security Standard, is an open
source standard. This is something that's free for you to use. When we say businesses can apply it
in their daily business and not even worry about certification, just make sure that they follow
those standards. This is an open document that you're able to use. It's not like the ISO where
you got to pay a chunk of money for a PDF. This is something that we want the entire industry to
have. So take that CCSS, grab the checklist, get those scenarios audited, get that practice in,
and then you'll be more than ready to crush that exam and become an auditor.
Yeah. And I think it's important too, to note that not just anyone can or should be a CCSSA.
You do need to have that security background. So I've been in crypto for five years and I am
not going to become a CCSSA because I do not have that kind of prerequisite knowledge about how to
look at security systems. And so most of the people who are going towards the exam that want
to become auditors have some background on either auditing and or other systems. So like they're
either, you know, QSAs or some other type of auditor and they know how to look into systems.
So if you're not an auditor, we do have an auditor guide that explains a lot of the processes, but
that knowledge about security is super important to understand what the standard is even asking
you to do in order to comply. So I just wanted to point that out, that there is a rich history
there of things that you do need to know to understand how the standard should actually be
enforced when you're looking at it. But let's talk about the auditor guide. So we're going to
put a link to it in the chats. And Noah, do you want to talk a little bit about what the
audit auditor guide entails and the peer review process?
Yeah, absolutely. Nice segue. You're a great MC. So yeah, we did produce an auditor guide. I think
there's sort of a notable piece of information here too, is that, you know, standards don't
often come, excuse me, with the guide immediately, right? They don't often come with direct
implementation tools about how you engage with the client, you know, what types of audit or
assessment methodologies and procedures you can apply to get the work done, to get to an audit
report or a certification end state. And so we thought that was really important. And so, you
know, the idea here is to provide really usable information about how do you go from looking at,
you know, an information system or working with management who's a maintained cryptocurrency
information system, and then how do you actually audit that? How do you engage with them? How do
you engage with them? How do you work through the process to get to the the end state? And so
you mentioned peer reviews, and that is a really important part here. I think that goes to the
some of the initial ethos here, the way I understand it, right, is that it isn't a just a
trust us or trust one person necessarily in this equation. And this is also something that's not
necessarily commonplace across security standards or certifications to have a peer review of this
nature. You do see in things like PCI DSS or ISO, you know, certifying body stamp over an internal
audit or an independent audit. So there are examples of it, but I think this is an even deeper
peer review process, right? It's not a rubber stamp. It's a review of the initial CSS, CSSA's
work. And so that's, I think, an important layer here, you know, to the end product is ultimately
more uniform when you think about a peer review process. And so that's an important
component. The auditor guide is developed, give credit to multiple people on the call,
because I didn't write it myself, right? This was a group effort and largely wasn't written by me.
So Petri gets a lot of credit. But, you know, Petri's background, for instance, isn't in audit,
right? He's conducted more of these external assessments and audits than he probably wants
to remember. And so this guide is informed by assurance industry, best practices, methodologies,
and procedures as well. And so that's super important, right? I think it's very important,
at least, right? That the end certification under the hood of that is really best practices that
are performed in the audits. The way that, you know, you assess a population of information,
you assess policy, you assess how controls are implemented, managed, and monitored over time.
There's information about sampling in there. So it should be a really usable guide for people,
for auditors. Yeah, the details, yeah, completeness, accuracy, etc. So I think that's
a great starting point, right? Like, frankly, if you look at like SOC 2, if you want to call
that a security standard, it's really more of a reporting, a controls reporting standard.
But, you know, often these reports are issued by CPAs. That's kind of an interesting example where
there is a SOC guide, but it doesn't actually give you, it doesn't really give the auditor
probably what they would really want. It's like, wait, what sampling methodology should I use?
Like, how many samples should I select here? What happens is CPA firms and other certifying
bodies tend to implement their own, you know, their own manual, right? Internally, their own
policy of how they go about doing these audits. And so there, again, you have disparity in
practice that can emerge, where one firm, you know, might be willing to sign off with very
little sampling or a lower level of control testing, where I think the CCSSA, the way this
audit guide is built, is there's some spirit of uniformity here, right, at the outset. So that's
good stuff. Yeah, and I think we're probably close on time. So the last thing that's been noted is
that, hey, this is an evolving thing. It is open source and open to input from the community here.
And so the auditor guide will inevitably grow, become more detailed, become more usable based on
the community's input. Yeah, absolutely. And I do know we're at time. So I want to continue answering
some of the questions we've had in the chat, but give everyone who's on this call an opportunity
to say goodbye. If you need to go on to the next thing, that's totally fine. I'm going to stay on
an answer. So if you need to go say goodbye, we so appreciate you spending the time you already have.
So I see Josh, Michael. Okay, thank you, Noah. Appreciate it. For those who thanks for a great
chat, everyone. Yeah, thank you so much. Appreciate it. We'll stay and answer some of the other
questions. So we'll see you the rest of you soon. So for those of you that are able to stay, I did
want to talk a little bit, I want to say one thing about the auditor process in the peer review is
we have actually just like within the past couple weeks even updated it. So we really are listening
to the community and making sure that this is something that is that the standard is the best
it can be. And that the audit process works for entities for the original CCSSA and the peer
reviewer. And importantly, that the entire purpose of this is so that end users are able to know
where to go, who to trust. And if there are things that need to be updated along the way,
we're certainly going to do it. Obviously, we have a committed group of people here. And Dirk,
did you want to say something about that? I just wanted to build off of that a little bit. And
that idea, yeah, that, you know, we could have just kept beating this to death before we released
the auditor certification program, right? Didn't we? Well, I mean, it feels like we did.
But that's not to say that we aren't aware that there are going to be people who come up and be
like, oh, so in my case, this, this, this and this, right? And there are probably even going
to be people who come up and just say, hey, why didn't you guys think about this? And every one
of us is going to hit ourselves in the forehead and be like, yeah, we should have thought about
that, right? But we, you know, we, I think we really strongly felt that, you know, the standard
had been out there long enough, and it's been kind of beat up long enough that it made sense
at this point with where the industry is with things that have been going on in the industry
very recently, that we really just needed to get this process out there and then let the process
get better along with everything else. So I guess that's kind of my, you know, don't just
flame us, contribute it, right? You know, if you see things that need improved, right, you know,
the entire process, if you go to the C4 website, right, it's structured to take input from people
in the industry. So, so, you know, help us, help us make it better instead of just being like, oh,
stupid CCSS doesn't cover this or the CCSA exam has this problem in it, right? So.
Yeah, we're definitely willing to and want to hear feedback from it. So we're,
we believe that it's really well done, but also none of us are clairvoyant. So we need to hear
feedback from other people, although I kind of wish I was. Okay, so a few other questions that
we have in the chat. The CCSS is being applied to centralized entities, but is it useful to
decentralized entities? Who wants to take that? I think there's different trade-offs for that,
right? And we can get into the whole mindset of centralized versus decentralized and whether
you're providing a service for the user or sovereignty for the end user or a specific
privacy conscious end user. I think one of the considerations specific to the CCSS that I would
be interested in is if you're operating in a decentralized capacity, some of the controls
recommend things like, do you know who your key operators are and have you perform the proper
background checks? And if you're operating in a system where maybe people are distributed
geographically and you have not had that face-to-face verification or contact,
or you're operating in a DAO where people are doing work under pseudonyms, right?
That may be harder to achieve those controls. So I think it's going to be pros and cons for both
systems, depending on what their offering is and what level of compliance they're going to.
It may be harder to achieve certain controls in decentralized versus a centralized system.
It may actually be easier in some cases with publishing things like proof of reserve,
right? You could automate that as a script. There's a lot of different ways,
I think, to achieve this stuff and trade-offs depending on how your system's built.
Yeah. And fundamentals around things like initial key generation and those sorts of things,
they apply regardless, right, Jim? Yeah. Okay. Another question is,
does the CCSS delve into smart contract code, such as emphasizing that certain best practices are
followed? I think so. Smart contracts are, when this was originally written, right,
not a technology that was fully implemented. Well, to some degree, right? But as new chains,
new chains, coins, as the system has evolved, we've seen different functionality, different
languages, different ways to achieve that smart contract functionality. This is something that,
as a committee, we're constantly meeting and throwing questions up about smart contracts
and sharding and MPC and how does that specifically affect key generation usage, storage,
and operations. And when it comes to smart contracts, yes, that's something that we are
building and looking at and saying, how does this fit and can these controls be applied to this?
There's nothing that says you have to use Solidity at this specific version, but I do imagine at some
point in time, we may end up diving deep into those specific types of details. So what I would
say is I think for smart contracts in DeFi, it's something we're constantly looking at and
evaluating and seeing how can the standard fit or apply into this specifically. I think with the
smart contracts, if I was looking at that against a standard and doing an assessment, I would be
looking at the key generation operation, who was the deployer? Are they known? What's the background
information on them? How did they do that deployment in that generation process and how is that being
maintained through the life cycle of the system? There's definitely some areas that aren't going to
be covered too, right? I mean, governance of the smart contract and things like that, right,
that are not currently going to be covered in the standard. Okay. So another question that we have
is, are we going to get a training like we created for the CBP? So yes, that is something in the work.
So we're on C4s and we have the Certified Bitcoin Professional course and prep book. And for the
Certified Ethereum Professional, we have a prep book coming out hopefully by the end of August.
And then we'll be creating a course for that. And we'll also be creating something for
the CCSS. I don't know, just to be transparent, we don't know what that will look like yet.
Like we've said, the standard changes, we need to keep up with different things. That's the same
with all of the exams, but we haven't actually, I'm not part of the committee, but the committee,
I'm in the meetings. I know the committee hasn't discussed this yet. I don't know if anyone has
thoughts on it and wants to talk about it. There's an awesome video recording from the
blockchain training conference. Yes. Thank you. Back in 2019 with it that Mr. Stoner did. That
is a really good foundation, right? If you want, obviously some things have changed since then,
right? And in going through this process and there've been some updates and the world of
crypto has changed around us a little bit as well. But it's a really good foundational training for
somebody who's wanting to look for that. And that's out there on the C4 YouTube site, right Jess?
I actually don't know if it's up right now. I don't think it is, but one of the things I
was thinking about is it would be fun to do that again. Ron, with you going through and teaching
how it all works and doing something now that we're able to be in person again,
but to do something like that. I think with something like this, it's really large. I think
the standard's huge. There's a lot more content and there are so many things that come with it
and a lot of questions that people are asking. I don't know how, and we can see if this would
work, but I don't know how well just a video recording of something would work. I think we
first should at least try another maybe in person to see what the questions are that come up.
But I don't know. I know that's not a good answer, but I don't want to promise something
we can't deliver. I do know that we want to create more educational resources around key management
and ownership and then also the CCSS, but I guess stay tuned for what ends up happening with that.
We do want there to be an easier way to become a CCSSA in terms of making sure that you understand
all the information. I don't know about you all, but when I sit down to read a large matrix
spreadsheet, I'm not like, ooh, this is the best time ever. I can see how having some type of
interactive or video course would be beneficial rather than just going through the standard
by yourself, but we'll have to see. I'd love to teach and educate Jessica, so that might be a
possibility, especially when it comes to security-related topics. I think the best
advice I could give to people while we're generating more of that educational supplementary
content is to, Josh alluded to it earlier, perform mock audits. The data is out there.
It's open source. You can go consume it. Take your favorite cryptographic information system,
the one you use every day or the one you're looking at saying, I wonder actually how secure
the system is, and just go through the checklist because what that'll do is that will allow you
to go pretty deep on things like the entropy of the system that generated the keys. Are they
reusing nonce values? What are the K values and digital signatures? If you're sitting there
going, I don't know what Ron's talking about right now, that's a great opportunity to deep dive into
that because these are the types of questions and things that are being validated and being
disclosed in these controls on the best way to go about those types of operations. I would tell
people, start to perform those mock audits, and you will get to things like what is a K value
and how do digital signatures actually work? Now that I know that, I can see how is this being
applied in the system and what level of compliance does that meet with the controls?
Yeah, I think even for people who don't want to be CCSSAs, like someone like me, who has really,
I've dove into the standard, I understand a lot of it, but some of the things that you're talking
about, I even would just want to know so that I feel more confident about it.
That I feel more comfortable using crypto, and I understand. I feel like there are different
levels. You aren't sure how crypto works, so maybe you're going to buy from an exchange,
you're going to set some of this stuff up, but then you want to... Stephanie Murphy has called it the
stairway to self-sovereignty. You start at just the basic of buying crypto on an exchange, and then
you hopefully learn to move it to maybe a hot wallet, and then you learn how to move it to
a self-custody hardware wallet, and then maybe you learn about multi-sig, and there's
kind of like that whole chain to figure this out. But starting small and then building up,
and I think it's the same thing with the CCSS. Start with the basics, and then as you get more
into it, you can start to grow and learn to really understand everything that's a part of it.
And I do know, Ron, that the course that you gave in 2019, everybody who attended it, that I've heard
from, absolutely loved it and found it super helpful. And I really wanted to go to it and then
couldn't because I was helping run the conference, but I do think doing something like that, again,
would be really helpful. Let's see here. I think we've covered all the questions that are in the
chat. Is there anything else anyone who's on the call wanted to talk about before we sign off?
Anything about the CCSS or the auditor exam? I think Noah hit it pretty early. You know,
we are only as good as you are with this stuff. There is a lot of things that people are thinking
of in their head going, what about XYZ? We want to know about XYZ so we can discuss it and throw it
against the wall and then pick it up and brush it off and put it back into the standard, right?
And that's going to make us better, the community better, and just all of these systems, these
information systems, better overall. So that is the biggest thing I would love to see to this.
If you're sitting there going, I've got ideas. I want to help. How can I help?
Please reach out. And we would love to get your feedback and start to encapsulate some of those
ideas. Yeah, I'm glad that you said that because there are eight people on the committee and
they're volunteering their time because, I mean, you all know this, it matters and you want to make
sure that the standard is the best it can be because you work and function within a space that
needs some help with security. And so I think it's really cool. I mean, I greatly appreciate all of
you volunteering and spending your time to make this standard as good as it can be in the exam.
And I think sometimes we see on the outside that there's been some work done, but there is so much
work that's happened behind the scenes with the monthly committee meetings and then oftentimes
additional meetings to discuss small different pieces with different members. And just, there's
a lot that has gone into this to make it and be very intentional to make it the best standard it
can be. But none of us are of the mentality that it can't get better, that we have everything
perfect for everything. I think it's an amazing standard. The amount of effort that's gone into
it is just incredible. But there are going to be things that change in the space, obviously,
that we're going to need to add and keep track of and all of that. Dirk, did you want to say
something else? No, just kind of along those lines, I wanted to address the rumor that I've
heard from a few people that I started growing my beard only to be more like Jameson. And that is
absolutely true. But for any of you out there that start growing a beard to be like Jameson,
he's still smarter. So, you know, it has limited value. I saw somebody post on LinkedIn about how
you have the best beard in the group, Jameson. So sorry, everyone else. I obviously not in that
group. So I wasn't offended. But that was something somebody posted. Okay, so before we end,
I just wanted to quickly give, I mean, I think the committee, you all are amazing. Behind the scenes,
our team at C4 has done just an amazing job. I wanted to thank Erica, Lisa, Miss Adrienne,
our web developer, Alejandro, there's been so much that's happened to get everything set up with the
exam and getting everything put on the website and all the little questions that have come in. So,
yeah, thank you all so much. The C4 team has just really stepped it up and been amazing to make
this happen. So thank you to each of you on the committee and to everyone else that has made this
possible. We will probably do another live stream at some point to talk about more of the specifics
in the standard. But I wanted to just thank you all for being here. And anything else anyone wants
to say before we go? So just a huge thank you to you, Jessica, for keeping us on track. I mean,
I mean, you, Jennifer, from your side really appreciate it. Yeah, we've got a great team
here. So thank you all. Appreciate it.

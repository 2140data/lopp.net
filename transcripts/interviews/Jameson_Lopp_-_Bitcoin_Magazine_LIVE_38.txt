Alright, let's get the video started.
How's it going everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Bitcoin Magazine Live. This is
episode 38 and we've got a packed episode today starting off with an interview. Casey
Carrillo of Bitcoin Magazine is going to be interviewing Texas Slim of the Beef Initiative.
Casey, if you want to take it away.
Yes. Before we begin, everyone, I want to see you in Miami, April 6 through the 9th at the
conference. I want to shake your hands. I want to invite you to meet the plebs in person. So
I'd be excited to see you all there. Get your tickets. I believe we have a discount code,
YTMAG. Can use that, get a little percentage off. And yeah, I mean, it'd be great to see y'all there.
But without further ado, I have an excellent guest today. So much interesting things to talk about.
But welcome to the show, Mr. Beef Initiative, Texas Slim.
Hey Casey, how are you doing today? Thanks for having me on, man. I've been looking forward to
this for a while. Absolutely. Ever since you gave us that article, I was looking to do something
more with it, maybe get some more word out. So, I mean, before we jump into the focus of the article
and such, why don't you just introduce yourself, tell us how you got into Bitcoin and just sort
of your Bitcoiner story. Sure. I mean, it's kind of interesting how I got into Bitcoin because it
basically helped launch me looking deeper into the food apparatus that we know. I come from Texas,
many generations. My ancestors were all agricultural ranching. And so I've always
been around food a lot, but what I never really did was dive deep into the intelligence of how
our food is basically grown anymore, how it is processed and how it's delivered in the market
access of our nutrition. So I'm pretty rough and tumble. I got kind of beat up about two years ago.
I had some physical stuff. I didn't get beat up, but I just got hurt. So I was laid up for a while
and I started looking into Bitcoin. I'd seen it. We get into it when we deserve. I got into it late,
but as I was laid up, I was getting into Bitcoin, but I was also diving deeper into the food because
I was having to watch what I was eating. I was like, Hey, let's revisit food. And it just took
me down a rabbit hole that was symbiotic with each other. And so I'm a big researcher and an
analyst. That's what I come from. I learned a lot of skills in Austin and most of my adult life was
in Austin working in startup companies. So I started leveraging my intelligence that kind of
gained as far as the skillset. And I embedded myself in a harvest company this past year.
And I started meeting people. I started researching the companies that were providing
the products as far as the pesticides, the herbicides, the grain that we grow. And it just
led me down a rabbit hole into further into Bitcoin. The further I got into food, I was
using the decentralized mindset, the ethos that we all strive for. And I started writing about it.
And then here we are today in a lot of things have transpired since I did that.
Absolutely. I mean, getting knocked down and getting back up with Bitcoin, you can't beat
that really. But it was a godsend, you know, being on my back for six months. You know,
what are you going to do? You're going to low time preference to survival to education to knowledge.
And so it was it was it was a gift. That's a excellent mindset to definitely to getting
knocked down. Let's let's talk about the beef initiative, which is your project. And can you
just tell us what it is, why it's important? Well, whenever I did the harvest of deception,
you know, we bring up seed oils, we're bringing out all the poison that we're eating and consuming
as people and civilians in the United States. I wanted to create a solution because you never
go into something and parrot the problem, you know, daily forever. Well, if you're going to
complain about something, you're going to identify an issue, you better have a solution that you can
present to people. So being from Texas and knowing Texas history and around pure animal protein
and the cow itself, I said, well, let's let's create something called the beef initiative
where we're going to get back to local local communities, hyper localization and leveraging
and everything we can in a decentralized way. Well, that was a cattle industry in the state
of Texas from day one. And you can do a lot of comparisons. So I said, well, let's get the beef
initiative going. Let's go talk to ranchers and educate them about Bitcoin because they've already
been living a decentralized life. That's what they know. So let's bring the philosophy of Bitcoin
into it. Let's bring that protocol into the conversation. Let's bring that new store of
value that they don't understand. And by educating the ranchers into Bitcoin, the ranchers are
educating us on what pure animal protein is again. And so we're looking at the protocols
that they use to basically raise their animal protein as far as, you know, if it's regenerative,
if it's what are the what products are they using, what types of style of ranching or
grass farming that they're doing. And we bring that into the conversation and we all try to get
to a better way of sourcing our pure animal protein. And so it's evolving and it's evolving
very fast because we're discovering things about our food industry as far as market access,
who controls the market access of our nutrition, who has the processing capabilities to process
our food, be it animal protein or if it be the grains. We don't know a lot of this stuff and
it's covered up in ways that, you know, people trust because our food industry has become a
big marketing plan. And that's all it is. I call it a global marketing plan because there is an
there is an effort to basically keep us as far as, you know, civilians, citizens of the United
States in the dark of what true food is. And it uncovers a lot of lies. So we're educating the
public what food intelligence is. Again, I tell people to look at their grandparents and see how
they ate or their great grandparents because they ate in a very different way from us. And you look
at the history of the United States right now, 78 percent of us are either obese or overweight.
One out of two of us is either diabetic or pre-diabetic.
Forty-six percent of kids between five and 11 are now obese or overweight. That's an issue.
And people aren't really looking at like, how is this happening? Well, we're going to break it down
and we're going to give you a solution. And therefore, we're going to let you be able to
source your animal protein in a way that the people don't see coming. It's going to be
decentralized. We're going to take out the centralization of our food supplies.
And we're basically striving to become the new beef industry in the United States.
And we're going to do it with the Bitcoin protocol.
Absolutely. So sort of taking the idealistic decentralization of Bitcoin and then applying
it to ranchers. I am curious. You mentioned that a sort of like symbiotic relationship of knowledge
between Bitcoiners and ranchers. And I think a lot of Bitcoiners can envision how Bitcoin could
help ranchers. Can you describe like how ranchers could help impact the Bitcoin community and some
of the practices they could teach us? Well, if you look at ranching from the day one,
they're based on community. They're based on different forms of communication.
They know manipulation of markets, of commodity markets, of futures markets, of grain prices,
everything that they have to battle every day. I tell people you get a fourth generational rancher
that's battled the last 40 years in what he's seen as far as trying to be able to be a productive
rancher in his community. He knows some things that Bitcoiners don't understand. So that rancher's
going to say, this is really the truth about our food supply. And you're going to understand
this Bitcoiner because you're not seeing this aspect of the food supply that is highly captured
and is something that you're not even aware of. But now that you're bringing this Bitcoin store
of value, whatever we want to call Bitcoin, everybody calls it something different.
Well, you're teaching me something I've already known, but now I get to take it to a new level.
You're sending me down a rabbit hole. I'm going to send you down a rabbit hole with food.
You're going to send me down a rabbit hole with Bitcoin. And they do, they work hand in hand.
Once you start seeing that correlation of our food in the centralized aspect of the industrial
food complex, and we look at the money supply and the Fed and the central banking system and how
it is corrupt on a centralized level, it's all the same. If you're talking money, you better be
talking food. If you're not, then you're missing something here. And it has to be symbiotic. And
the rancher and the Bitcoiner can actually bring that clarity to a lot of people's understanding.
Yeah, like the parallels between the problems with the centralization of the money system
and the food system seem very related. They seem almost the exact same thing, just in different
iterations. So Bitcoin, like you said, is sort of like this, the latest technological iteration
of the decentralization that's been in practice in ranching for a long time.
But moving on, I guess one question I would ask is what's the most important thing for
people to understand about our food supply today? Like I said before, our food supply
has nothing to do with nutritional value. That is the last thought that we come to
as far as the corporations that are designing our food systems and processing our food.
Once again, it is a marketing plan. It has no basis of truth anymore. You look at how they're
basically pushing the fake meat products now that they are. We look at where is the
motivation coming from? Well, they're trying to basically outlaw the cow. They're making a carbon
hazard. And so by the manipulation of what food truly is, and as far as what pure animal protein
can do for our nation and our body, this is how we got here. We didn't get here with processed
food. We got here, our strength lied, laid, and is the foundational truth that our strength as
a nation came from animal protein. You cannot contest that fact. And so what we do as far as
bringing that education to everybody, it's something that if you understand the manipulation
in the marketing plan, what the food industry is about, and how highly subsidized our food
industry is, then you're going to start seeing that there's a lot of cracks in the labeling,
in the education of what food really is, as far as calling something organic, using grass fed
as a label. Well, those labels are, to this point, are manipulated in ways people do not understand.
They don't understand that there's a thousand chemicals this year that's going to be added
to the food supply. The FDA won a lawsuit in October of 2021, and basically it's under the
grass rule. That's something called generally recognized as safe. If the FDA says that basically
it is safe, they can put that chemical in your food supply. They don't have to tell you what that
chemical is. And so why are they introducing a thousand new chemicals into our food supply
this next year? Now you look at our food, we can't pronounce the names of those on the labels
anymore. Nobody can. Nobody understands what they're consuming anymore. You look at what are
those chemicals. Those are fake commodities that we are basically being forced to ingest
through our food supply system. Where do those chemical companies come from? Well,
they come from companies like Bayer, Monsanto, Cargill, the people that are manipulating our seed
into a genetically modified organism. Well, now they're not even going to start using genetically
modified organism, GMO, that it's going to be bioengineered. And people don't understand that.
What is bioengineering? Well, let's introduce nanoparticles. Let's introduce all these kind
of new chemicals that you are going to be ingesting. A lot of those new chemicals and
particles that we're going to be ingesting is now going to be the new fake protein delivery
that they're trying to orchestrate and engineer for people to understand that, hey, this is better
than the cow. It's an orchestrated effort. They're coming after our food supply in ways that people
don't understand. Look at the health of our nation. Look what just happened in United States in the
last two years. Our health is compromised. And so let's look at why. Well, it's because our food
supply is compromised because our dollar has lost its value, especially since 1971, we went off the
gold standard. Once we went off the gold standard, our dollar was devalued. Our food supply was
devalued. Why do we have the type, if you look at pictures from 1970 to 2022 of our nation as a whole,
you can find unlimited representation of how unhealthy we have become as a nation. Why is
that happening? Well, it's because of our consumption model. And it's an industrial
food complex that is designed to basically make food a marketing plan with low nutritional value.
It all comes back to the cheapening of the money, right? So the incentives get misaligned.
And then we end up with an industry where, like you said, we built this country off of animal
protein. But if you incentivize cheaper and cheaper food, animal protein becomes unsustainable.
One thing I wanted to bring up, though, a common misconception is that we might just be talking
about processed food. Can you talk about how this is a bit more systemic and it comes from
something as fundamentally basic as the soil, which would affect every part of our food chain,
not just something that's processed, right? Well, starting with the soil, I always say
we got to get to the source of the seed. The source of the seed is the issue. Well,
the source of the seed usually takes growth within that soil. And throughout, especially
the last 50 something years, since 1971, we went to something called monocropping. And what we did
monocropping, Eric Butz was part of the Nixon administration. And he said, hey, we're going
to go big or go home. What did that mean? He goes, well, you're going to go fence to fence now.
And that's whenever we introduce pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified seeds into our
food system. Well, what did that mean? It means the farmer, he couldn't do four to five crops
anymore. He was going to go fence to fence with one crop. And he was going to use this type of
pesticide or herbicide to grow that food. Well, those chemicals throughout the 50 years,
and this is a whole different podcast. You go from the chemical company that designed Agent Orange
during Vietnam is the same chemical company that designed Roundup that we've been using the last
50 years. And so as we've killed our basically medical health, we've killed our soil too.
And a lot of people don't understand what soil is. They just say it's dirt. But as far as our soil
is concerned, the chemical companies that have been growing our food for the last 50 years have
destroyed the soil in a way that a lot of people do not understand. We don't have a lot of sustainable
soil that we can use anymore. That's whenever we look at soils, like how can we regrow our soil?
And that's when the regenerative conversation comes in. And we're saying, this is what we really
need to be looking at. We don't need to be looking at the centralized form of monocropping, pesticide,
herbicide type of system that has gotten us here. But the same people that are starting to try to
control the regenerative aspect of our soil are the same ones that destroyed the soil in the first
place. That's why they're taking animal protein out of it. They're saying we can build all your
food in these labs. We can do stem cell growth of animal protein. We can have the fake meat
products that are done with soy and pea protein, which is basically poisonous to me in my eyes.
And a lot of scientists believe this as well. There's so many things that we're not talking
about, but it does start with how do we rebuild our soil as a nation?
Right. And I mean, I think we can even reframe like the environmentalist perspective from going
like we need to reduce carbon emissions too. We need to take care of our soil. That is our
environment and the environment is what produces our food for us. Of course. I mean, that's how you
read the carbon problem that they're trying to orchestrate as far as everything's moving
to a carbon credit economy. A lot of people, they don't understand what that means. Well,
it means you're going to be a bad citizen if you eat beef. And they're going to say,
oh, that cow, he's a carbon hazard. So as far as saving the planet and everybody that's
a lot of idealistic people are thinking that they're pointing their compass in the wrong
direction and how we save the planet is getting cow land tools back on our soil and our grass
and let them basically regrow our soil. And let's get this carbon problem under control
with the land tools that got us here from the very beginning from the bison, just how our great
grasslands in the United States, how they were formulated and protected for thousands of years
was because of the land tools that were on them. And that was the bison. Right. I think, you know,
nowadays we have a problem of trying to modernize every problem that we have, right? Trying to take
some advanced technology and address the issue when a lot of the times the answer lies in the
past and what we used to do and how humans have taken care of the earth for thousands of years
prior to all this technology. Well, we get too smart for our own good. You know, my grandfather
was the smartest man that I'll ever meet. And most of everybody that is listening to this could
probably look over their shoulder and say, that's the smartest person I ever knew. I just didn't
realize it. So let's look back at them. Let's, let's leverage what they knew because they really,
you know, I always tell my grandmother and grandfather, they had a party line system
in which they communicated. They decentralized their whole life. They fed their community.
They fed their neighbors and their neighbors fed them. That's what all, you know, everybody talks
about in the Bitcoin world. There's so much that we can learn if we look back over our shoulders
and said, that's where the intelligence was. Let's leverage that historical value of how they got to
where they were able to let us evolve to where we are now. Let's quit trying to be so modern day
smart. Cause you know, this is a small problem. If you look at the history of, you know, humans and
you know, just in the nation, United States, 50 years is a very small, you know, a grain of sand
in the time of space that, you know, we've been consuming and evolved. So what was the last 50
years? That's all we really have to look at. We don't have to get any more crazy than that.
And it's pretty easy to break down that we were doing it right. Not too long ago. We can get back
there pretty fast. I think that's like a, a hopeful thing to hear. I think like a lot of times it
feels like we're fighting battles that just will never get resolved within our lifetime, at least.
So, uh, it, you know, it's excellent to hear that at least one of the more pressing issues, I think
could be resolved if we were to take these ideas and sort of spread them, uh, as quick as possible.
Uh, jumping off that though, you know, what are, you know, we've identified this problem. Uh,
what are some steps that everyday people, Bitcoiners, people listening to the podcast,
what can they do to sort of reclaim their food sovereignty as we describe?
Yeah, I've, I've focused in this is it's very simple for me. I grew up eating pretty good food
and, you know, I've always eat crap food just like we all do. But one thing is we get to status about
food. We, we make it so freaking black and white, and it's not a black and white issue here, man.
Each individual is going to have their own experience, their own basically place they are
in the, in the consumption model that we live in. You don't have to be overly crazy. You don't have
to worry about diets and all kinds of things that get shoved down our throats that never work.
They're on a scale of a fiat scale. Every 13 months, there's a new diet plan. Every 13 months,
there's something now. And then every 13 months, people are doing it all over again. The hamster
will of consumption is just amazing. So let's just get basic with it. You know, I start and I tell
everybody, just get rid of the freaking seed oils out of your life. That's it. Try it out. And I
guarantee you that one little quick little move is canola oil or whatever seed oil that's out
there. If you eliminate that and you pay attention, intentional decision, intentional decision-making
saying, I'm not going to consume, let's say soy oil, canola oil, or any other type of seed oil.
And I'm going to, it'll be a gradual process, but if I'm very aware and I'm looking at these labels,
I guarantee you're going to go down a rabbit hole and you're going to say, man, I need to look
at how I'm delivering my protein in my nutrition to my body a little bit closer. And this can be
a gradual process. You don't have to worry about diets. You don't have to go out and have a major
workout plan. All you have to do is be intentional about looking at a label. I don't shop at the
grocery store anymore. Maybe twice a month, I'll go to the grocery store. Everything else I'm
sourcing locally. So I, you know, with the beef initiative, we're bringing people back to their
local protein sources and we're creating market access to saying, I'm going to go meet this rancher
and I'm going to shake his hand. I'm going to say, thank you. How can you help me? And how can I
help you? And you're going to have a conversation. So cutting out seed oils and let's go find your
local rancher. If you don't have a local rancher, if you're living in the middle of Boston or
Manhattan, that's okay. Come to the beef initiative. We're going to give you a database
that you're going to be able to search and you're going to be able to find a way to source your
protein. And you're going to eliminate walking down those middle aisles at the supermarkets.
You're not going to need seed oils anymore. And your diet is going to change naturally
and holistically. You're going to create a new kind of lifestyle that you didn't realize
that is as easy as it can be. Everybody says it's more expensive to buy from a rancher. It's not. I
spend less money now than I ever have on groceries. I eat twice a day. I eat so much protein every day.
I don't, I'm never hungry. I don't think about food in the way that I used to when I was eating
this highly processed food apparatus. And it's something that, man, I just want to scream from
the rooftops and it's not that hard to do. And Bitcoiners are very intentional. We're very
proof of work driven. This is a small amount of proof of work that if you put into your basically
consumption model, as far as the content that you're allowing into your head, as far as what
is real nutrition and what we know is real nutrition, your life will change pretty fast.
And there's a lot of people jumping on board and within the beef initiative, come tell us
how you mine your protein. Write an article. We'll publish it for you so you can share it
to the other Bitcoiners. If you have a good local rancher that you're already proven that's proof
of work, come to the beef initiative, put your producer into the, there's a page in there where
you can put your local rancher, talk about your local rancher and his protocol and how he's raising
his beef. We're creating a big collective conversation right now. We're crowdsourcing
all the intelligence that the Bitcoiners have, and we're sourcing all the intelligence that the
ranchers have, and we're bringing everybody together. And I can't tell you how many groups
I have on Signal and Telegram that we got three or four ranchers talking to each other. Then
they're talking to Bitcoiners at the same time. This stuff is about to take hold and they're
learning about each other and they're educating each other and everybody's getting healthy as
they're doing it.
I mean, so to reiterate, the beef initiative is really about connecting beef producers,
ranchers with beef consumers, eliminating the middleman, and then extracting the benefits
from that situation and spreading it further. And I think we're really poised to adopt and
really want this. People really have a distrust of things right now. I think people are learning
more about their food supply, more about what they're eating, just because people are doing
more research online about things. And I think this, the beef initiative, is really a way for us
to regain that control over the food supply. Was that fair to say?
I'm thinking big here. It started out like Texas Beef Initiative and it's like, no, this is bigger.
This is not about borders. This is a global thing. And it's kind of right now, it's not a
production company, but what it is, it is creating a conversation that everybody's wanting to have.
And what we're doing is we're coordinating that conversation and we're connecting some nodes.
We're building some nodes out. We're building some really good, powerful local communities again.
And the only way you build community is through your food source. I mean, that's it. If you don't
have a food source in your local community, you don't have a community. And so by leveraging
the spirit that's going on as awareness and people are awakening to this type of issue within our
food supply, giving that solution of like, let's facilitate this in a way that we all know how to
do it because we're going to show some proof of work. We're going to onboard each other into a new
lifestyle that a lot of people in the centralized world do not understand. And that's our power
right there. And then it is happening. I haven't talked much about this, but I've been putting a
team together for a good while now. It's been over a year and we're in the state of Texas.
We have a lot of laws and a lot of things that we can leverage as far as animal protein processing.
So we have a very good model for processing facilities in the state of Texas that can scale
pretty large on a global level, or I'm sorry, on a national level, but also on a local level.
We're going to become a processing association consulting advisory board through the beef
initiative. I've built the team. I got the green light just last night. And so people are going to
come to us in the state of Texas. They're ready. They're already lined up. There's a lot of capital
out there saying, we're going to change a processing industry in the state of Texas.
So by saying that in the year 2022, most people in the state of Texas, I'm going to encourage
most of them to come to the beef initiative because we have a team of people that will be
able to facilitate you getting through the regulations, getting through the inspection
process, building out the facilities to the USDA. We have precedents. We have a lot of things that
I don't think it's ever been put together. So I'm pretty excited about it. There's going to be some
new news coming out in the next month or so, how we'll approach that, how people can approach us,
how we can vet you on a financial level, on your intentions, on your local communities.
We're going to build a plan where if we build a processing center and we help you build that
processing center, we're going to propose that you give 5% of that back to your local community
so they can educate people about what food is again, about the young people in that community
where they don't have to go to the big cities anymore. They can stay in that local community
and they can be part of the processing of the food for that local community. So there's a lot
that is about to be released as far as that information. And that's going to be pretty
powerful. A lot of people will be able to advise other states and saying, hey, these are the rules
and the laws of your state. This is what is in Texas. Let's look at that and see how we can get
your local communities involved just like we're doing in Texas. Yeah. Texas Slim, if I can jump
in here real quick, it's awesome. I love everything that you're saying and building out a team.
Have you guys built out a plan for, I guess, countering attacks or what attacks do you see
on you guys? I mean, right now in Canada, we're seeing obviously attacks on people's money in
the banking system and Bitcoin in general. Aside from attacking the money, do you see other ways
that they could attack you guys, whether it's imminent domain to try and take your land or
shutting off the servers for beef initiative itself? I guess if you want to give any insight
on that. That's going to be very interesting because I've had a lot of conversations with a
lot of ranchers. I've talked to ranchers where their cattle were not seized, but their bank
accounts were seized because of certain things. And you follow the money, of course, and it goes
straight into corruption. So they always are worried about the money getting seized. And the
more they learn about Bitcoin and the faster they do, they're going to be very happy for that.
As far as being attacked, it's going to be interesting because they're not going to be able,
they can attack us. But I like to tell people that we're going to know the law
better than the law knows itself now. A lot of the regulations and the laws that we follow within our
food industry, our government really, our local governments, our state governments and our national
governments are very detached from each other. There's a lot of indecision, but the type of
intelligence that I'm bringing into that aspect of it, they can attack us, but we have USDA
precedents. We have federal precedents, we have state precedents, and we have local
county jurisdiction precedents. That's not something a lot of people can say. So as far
as them attacking us from that perspective, it's going to happen. I'm not too worried about that.
Let's look at technology. We're going to have to build basically a platform system that is
decentralized and using everything that's being innovated in the Bitcoin space. I'm looking at
weekly saying, hey, what's going out there as far as innovation? I'm going to have a podcast with
Jimmy Song pretty soon. I want people to start looking at, hey, how can we help the beef initiative
to stay decentralized where they can't censor us, that they can't take us offline, that we're not
part of AWS and they can shut us down because we're getting too much leverage into the food
conversation because they're marketing it very heavily right now. There's documentary after
documentary coming out that dairy cows are now horrible and we torture dairy cows. Just the
amount of deception and propaganda that's about to hit this year is going to be massive because
they've spent hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars for this fake meat industry and these
fake commodities that they're going to start pushing on everybody saying that it's saving
the planet. There's cracks in anything. We'll see how they come after us. I'm going to be very
public and very transparent. So it's not going to be a big attack. It's just going to be solution
driven and if they wanted to talk about our solution, sit down at the table with us and
tell us what we're doing wrong because we're going to be able to have the conversation
exactly straight back at you too. So here we go. Bitcoin exposes everything. So I'm not too worried
about that. Definitely. I think we could even consider what you were describing with the attacks
on the dairy industry and things like that as more of like a subversive type attack on the
beef initiative even if it's indirect but luckily people hunger for this right now just like they're
hungering for Bitcoin. I think there's like this feeling within people that there's something more
to the system why they're getting sort of dragged down and I think the beef initiative sort of
fills that hunger in the same way that Bitcoin does just for food instead of money but I mean
we've sort of touched on so many things here that could be coming out of this. Would you
just describe maybe beyond the beef initiative what the primary change you want to see come out
of the adoption of Bitcoin? People are walking around in a haze right now. There's a lot of
brain fog in this world and one thing that this is like I said this is not a judgment. This is not
about a diet. This is about your spirit. This is about your strength as a person, as a parent,
as a young man, a young woman in this nation. There's a solution right in front of us
and the more we look down this rabbit hole of Bitcoin and that adoption starts coming forward
we're going to win because we're sourcing our minds with the best nutrition that is available
on this planet. You can't argue with that. If you want to argue with that I encourage you to please
keep eating your chicken tendies in your hot pockets and just try to stay up with us because
we're going to win because our minds are powerful, our bodies are strong, our spirit is based
and we're coming from truth. You can't argue with that. I've got a couple of years on you guys.
One thing you do understand, you get a little wise, you say I'm doing it right and I'm not
going to let people get in the way of that and that's what the beef initiative is. It comes
with the strength. It's the beef initiative. It's from damn Texas. We're going to stand toe to toe
with anybody and we've got some fortitude. We've got some history. We've got some legacy. We've
got some heritage. We've got some tradition. I want all the big pointers to bring that type
of energy into this fight and start fighting for your food and quit treating it as entertainment.
It can be entertainment but from a pure stance and I have no doubts that's how we win in the
long run. We'll be stronger than anybody else and once we hyper localize our food systems
I talk to my local producer every two weeks. I shake his hand. We're good friends. My freezers
for my whole family are full of beef right now. I'm eating for the next two years. I have no stress
that the rest of the world's talking about right now. I don't have to participate that. That allows
my mind, my body, and my spirit to go deeper into innovation as everybody else is parroting the
issues at hand right now. I'm not worried about that stuff because we're in the solution right
now and we're living in the solution and I think Bitcoiners are going to start understanding that
they can do that on their own individual level in their state, in their region, in their county,
in their town, wherever it is where they need to start. They're going to get empowered pretty
fast and we're going to work together to do that. Yeah, I am curious there on a note. Do you
in the short term, do you foresee issues in the beef supply? You talk about stockpiling. Do you
see it being difficult to find producers or are you referencing mostly like grocery stores? I'm
just curious. The way I see how this playing out and nobody knows. I mean, we all act smart,
but if I had to make a prediction, I think that right now what's going on with the food supply
systems, just look at Canada, how they're shutting and how things can shut down overnight. Joe Rogan
and Adam Curry brought up the facts. It's like Manhattan can get cleaned out in a day and a half
to three days of all food. Well, that's not that hard to orchestrate a short-term food supply
shortage. So how are they doing it already? Well, they're inflating the price of beef and saying
that there's not enough cows. Well, that's a lie. Well, they say it's because of COVID. Well,
that was orchestrated by them. So the amount of a manipulation has been going on with our food
supply is big. And I think that we will see a short-term food supply. What I know that they're
trying to do for a fact is turn beef into caviar. When they do that, they eliminate a lot of people
being able to purchase good animal protein. Well, what are they going to supplement? Well,
these new fake commodities that they're engineering into our systems. They're engineering
into our mindsets right now. So yeah, I believe that they are going to attack the beef this year.
I think that it's always been attacked. And this is nothing new, but it's on a new scale.
It is ramping up. I would say you don't even put yourself in that position. Right now, be very
intentional. Show some proof of work that you're going to be serious about how you're going to eat
for the next six months and take care of it. It's not about MREs. It's not all that. Just
whatever you can do as an individual, there's ways to do it that all of us can use and share
as a solution. And it doesn't have to all be beef either. It's animal protein. It's whatever,
you know, lamb. I'm bringing a lot of people that, you know, sheep farmers, we're bringing in pork,
we're bringing in fowl. There's just so many ways that you can source your animal protein.
Let's not even pay attention to the distraction. Something's going to happen. I'm not even thinking
about it anymore because I'm secure and that's what everybody else needs to be too. And once
we're secure and, you know, the world is falling apart around us as far as food supplies, we're
going to be able to innovate even faster because in times of prohibition, and this is what people
really in the Bitcoin world need to understand, in times of mass prohibition creates mass innovation.
That is our responsibility as Bitcoiners. This is why we're in this game right now.
We don't need to keep on bringing ourselves down with all the negative news about food and all that.
We need to be the change and we need to be the distraction. And we have the ability to do that
because we're pretty based. Yes, we are pretty based, I think. I mean, to speak to your point,
admittedly, I'm not connected to the beef initiative, which I need to be now that I've
learned more about it. But so I purchased my beef from the grocery store and in the last year alone,
the prices have so dramatically changed that my consumption has changed. I've had to choose
cheaper cuts of beef often, more often than I would like. I used to eat a lot of really nice,
fatty rib eyes. And that has, you know, I'm doing that a lot less often now because they're
30 bucks, you know, and it's incredible how this, you know, something as simple as like a 15%
inflation increase can change people's diets and therefore their foundation of their health.
There you go. I mean, and this has been happening for 50 years in ways people don't understand.
This is the most current model of making a young man as yourself eat less of what you should be
eating. That makes you less powerful. You fight less, you're empowered less. There's so many
things that happen across the board whenever you have had to change your consumption model.
One thing that a lot of people don't look at, I like to paint the picture in the long term,
the more we adopt Bitcoin as far as the store value in the beef industry,
the more basically the beef goes down in price, the more that the supermarket beef goes up,
the local rancher goes down. And you'll start seeing that within probably this year, next year,
within the next three years, we won't have problems with the prices of beef because we'll
have a store value that's being leveraged that they didn't understand, especially the last three
years and how the inflated beef prices have started affecting us as a nation. So there's a
lot of little things in there. Let me give you an example. I call it the modern day cattle drive
and to give you some understanding about how this happens. There's a bunch of cattle down in
Brazil. They get driven to Mexico. Mexico finishes off with a lot of different types of grains
and a lot of grains that, you know, we'll just say that they're not the best of grains.
That cattle then goes into Texas. Texas processes that cattle. Well, they get to say,
hey, that's USDA stamp. That's good old premium beef. Okay. Well, it's not the best beef in the
world, but you know, guess what? Texans have to eat that beef. All the cattle was raised in beef,
a million cattle a year get sold in Texas, never have any access to that cattle. And so we're
eating sub par beef as we're shipping our damn good beef across the seas. People don't know
that you're thinking you're getting local beef or you're getting something that's in the United
States, not even in the United States. It goes through a lot of touch points before you even
get to consume that now very expensive piece of beef. So there's so much you need to learn
about sourcing your beef locally with very few touch points. And you talk about the expensive
cuts. We all love the sirloins. There's three, four, five different cuts of a cow that you never
have access to because it's used in different ways through the industrial food complex. If you're
talking to that local ranchers, you're saying, I want all of that cow. I want to leverage the
ox tail. I want the tongue. I want the shank. I want the Denver cut. I want the Kansas City cut.
I mean, there's so many different types of parts of the cow that we don't even know that we can use.
Let's talk about the bones, getting you the bones whenever you get a quarter or a half a cow.
There's a lot to leverage within that where you're going to eat differently and you're going to eat
even more based. Basically, right now you're having to compromise. Once you start sourcing
from your local rancher, you're going to step up your game even more that you don't even realize
at this point in time. Absolutely. I recall reading about Safedin has talked about this before
where when I go to the grocery store, I pick up this little pre-packaged thing in a little
plastic wrap that's just cut. And like you said, there's so much to the cow that we're just not
even seeing. That does play an important role in our health and nutrition that we could be
consuming, but it's not being created that way. Moving on here, there are so many interesting
things happening in the Bitcoin space. What's something that's coming up soon or you're looking
forward to in particular here? Well, I've been quiet as far as how are you going to be able to use
Bitcoin to purchase? Right now, we just launched the beef initiative. It's kind of a soft launch,
but people are finding out more about it. We're offering beef boxes from K&C Cattle there in
Austin, and it's Cole Bolton. We're good friends now. I reached out to Cole very early on. So we
designed to say we need to get beef to the Bitcoiners and they need to be able to purchase it with
Bitcoin. Not everybody's going to separate themselves from Bitcoin. That's another
conversation, but we need to bring the Bitcoin into beef discussion and beef into Bitcoin
discussion. We thought this was a perfect entry point. What I like about what we've been able to
do is partnership with the Yoshi app. And they're about to do a major release finally,
and they've been onboarding a lot of different merchants across the United States, especially
down in Austin. And so the ease of use of transactional Bitcoin is going to be here pretty
quick and you're going to be able to buy beef with Bitcoin. And so that's the most exciting
thing that I've really been focused on, to tell you the truth, because it's been a long journey
and it's been very fast and all of a sudden it's about to get pretty powerful. And what's cool
about using and partnering with the OSHA app, if you go out and find Casey, if you find your local
rancher and you go out there and shake his hand, you go to the beef initiative, you're going to
download the OSHA app. Okay. Well, if you onboard that rancher onto the OSHA app and he starts
making transactions with the OSHA app, because basically there's a rewards program within the
OSHA app. Every time he makes a sell as that rancher or local animal producer, supplier,
whoever it is, and they use the OSHA app and you onboarded him, you're going to get sats back on
every purchase that is ever made through that rancher. So you're going to have incentive models
that you don't see coming. That rancher is going to get sats back. He's going to be able to offer
things to his customers that he's never been able to do to. So there's a lot of new information
that's about to come out with the OSHA app, how to onboard through the beef initiative with the
OSHA app. And I think we're going to have a lot of guys driving around the country, trying to
onboard ranchers here pretty fast. Heck yeah. I think so. I mean, the incentives exist and
I think Bitcoiners want to buy their beef through that. Why not? Well, you know, that's the thing
about it. You look at the rancher, he has to pay 2.7% on his credit card transaction fees.
Okay, rancher, you don't really have to do a lot with Bitcoin, but just keep that 2.7% transaction
fee in Bitcoin and come back in six months and see what that has done for you and start leveraging
that. Get your mindset into that. And once they start understanding that and they have the ease
of use of transactional with the OSHA app and the software that we're providing to them, man,
this is a snowball effect that's about to start happening. And once coffee shops, all the
restaurants across Austin, and when they're all using the OSHA app, you go to a restaurant and
you say, hey, where do you get your beef? Well, our rancher is on the OSHA app or that restaurant
on the OSHA app. You get to onboard every touch point of your food anymore. People need to look
at it like that. How many places is my food coming from? Well, it's coming from my local rancher,
down to this steakhouse, and me. And all three of us are partners now because we downloaded the OSHA
app and we're all getting Sats back. That's never been done before.
I love that you said we're all three partners now. That's how the food chain should exist.
The rancher benefits from the steakhouse that's buying his beef, and then the customer can go in
and be satisfied knowing that that chain isn't disturbed at any point. I mean, that's excellent.
Real quick here, I got to tell everyone, if you're not going to Miami April 6th or the 9th, what are
you even doing? You're going to want to be there. Make sure to use the code YTMAG to get a nice
percentage off your ticket purchase, but ticket prices go up, I think, in two days. So you best
be getting those tickets, man. I mean, I want to see you all there. But Texas Slim, if people want
to get involved in the initiative, they want to work with you, help you, how can they connect to
you and how can they get involved? The best way right now, on Twitter, we have
at beef initiative is our handle. And then of course, mine is at modern team, man. I've been
really open about if you want to schedule a meeting with me just to discuss, there's a calendar that
you can sign up. I want to talk to everybody. I want to hear everybody come in. And we're trying
to accommodate all of the input that's coming in. I want everybody to go to the beef initiative.
Go to mine your protein section. Tell us about how you mine your protein, right? And then we'll
approve it and we'll post it and everybody in the Bitcoin space can read about it and we can have
feedback. We can start that conversation. If you know your local producer, if you know a producer
across the United States that you use, put them, go to the producer section of the beef initiative,
put your producer in there and help them out. Let them get some exposure. And once we start that,
we create a new algorithm around the conversation that we're going to be having this year.
One thing that I want everybody to know, we're having four conferences this year across the
United States, and they're going to be the beef initiative conferences. And we're starting off
in Kerrville, April 23rd, 24th, and 25th. We're going to have speakers there. Marty Benz is going
to be speaking. Adam Curry is going to be speaking. Cole with KNC Cattle is going to be speaking.
And we're going to have two or three more speakers. And it's all going to be combining basically
everything that we just discussed this last hour. And we're going to do that across the United
States now. And a lot of people are going to start paying attention and come to them and start
meeting people in the food industry in ways that hasn't been done yet. And this is how we
decentralize that conversation. Yeah, distributed distributed beef initiative. There you go.
There you go. But it's at beef initiative on Twitter, at modern team and for Texas himself.
And I mean, is there any questions that I didn't get to ask you that you want to talk about?
Texas? No, I mean, I think it's a broad discussion. And you know, I really do appreciate just kind of
kicking it off. It's a good general base knowledge of understanding, hey, this is where we start.
Let's work together. Let's not be a bunch of, you know, there's a lot of people in the space that
want to point that, like I said, this is not black and white here. We're going to start the
conversation. We're all going in a good direction here. And it's about decentralizing our food
system. And it's not about being a carnivore or a vegan either. This is about pure produce,
pure animal protein, pure nutrition. This is what we need to be talking about. We don't need to be
pointing fingers at each other and having all these fights. That's the distraction. We don't
want to parrot the distraction. We want to become the solution. And we are the distraction now.
And you know, if we had that mindset, you know, the truth, you know, the truth will come out
and everybody would be a lot better off for it, especially in the Bitcoin space.
Yep. The, the foundations of food. We're going to, we're going to fix them folks. We're going to get
back to where we were. But thank you so much for joining me, Texas. It's really been an excellent
conversation and I hope, you know, people reach out to you, man. I appreciate the exposure. You
know, everybody come along for the ride. This is a 10 year plan, you know, just like what they're
trying to do to us right now across the globe with, you know, with the COVID, this is a 10 year
food plan and we're going to do it one step at a time. And so let's do it together. Let's,
let's, let's be based. Let's show some proof of work.
Heck yeah. And we all get to have some really good steak while we're at it.
Damn right. Let's get started.
Heck yeah. Well, thanks again, Texas, everyone. Thank you for joining me for this
excellent episode of meet the plebs. Again, I better see you in Miami in April. I mean,
I just, I got to, got to shake your hands guys. So get your tickets, white TMAG and
thanks again, Texas. See y'all later. Appreciate you guys. Take care of us.
Thanks, Texas slim. And thanks Casey. We're going to go to a quick commercial break and then I'm
going to be interviewing Jamison Lopp of Casa. So we'll be back in a short second. Talk to you later.
All right. Welcome back everyone. I have the pleasure of interviewing the co-founder
and CT of Casa Jamison Lopp. Jamison, thanks for coming on the show.
My pleasure.
It's a blast to have you here. So for the people that missed the episode with Andrew or
at e-currency, he was on a couple of weeks ago. Can you describe to our listeners,
what Casa is, what their platform is and what they're trying to do?
Sure. I mean, what we're really trying to do is what I've been focused on for
seven, eight years now, which is bringing the promise of being your own bank to the average
person. So we're just trying to make self-custody as simple, straightforward, user-friendly and
also bulletproof, especially against foot guns and the user basically screwing up because there's a
million ways you can screw up. And we do that using a variety of technologies, but nothing novel.
We're basically using various standards and technologies that are a part of the Bitcoin
ecosystem, things like multi-sig and hardware devices for key management. And we put them all
together in one nice package with a slick mobile app interface on top of it. Let that help you
basically manage your keys and your self-custody. And along with that, you're also providing a high
level of service so that if you are new, if you do encounter some weird edge case, then there's
someone there to help you. So you don't have to send an email and wait for three months and hope
that a customer support person will eventually respond to you.
Yeah. You've obviously been in the space much longer than me. I'm the class of 2020,
so I consider myself a very new Bitcoiner. I haven't lived through a full halvening cycle
or a four-year cycle. So when did you get into Bitcoin and what made you develop and start
Kaza and when, if you don't mind. Yeah, I've been a Bitcoin enthusiast for a decade now.
And it was just an interesting side project hobby for me for several years, where one of the first
things that I did was actually fork the Bitcoin core repository and added in a bunch of statistics
and metrics and data collection, just trying to expose more data for developers and other people
in the ecosystem to better understand what the Bitcoin nodes were doing. And after a couple
years of just going to meetups and talking to people on Twitter and forums, I went full time
in 2015 and started building infrastructure for BitGo, where we were basically helping
enterprises secure their hot wallets. And after doing that for three years, I did a small pivot
and helped co-found Kaza, where we're using some of that same technology, like multi-signature
technology, and bringing that to the retail user, the average pleb, so that they can start to
self-custody and really be confident that they can do that. Because I think that's one of the big
pieces of friction that's resulting in a lot of people still leaving their keys and their coins
with third parties, is that they feel like it's safer to trust the experts to take care of that,
rather than take on the responsibility of doing it themselves.
Yeah. I mean, if the Canada Freedom Convoy isn't proof of that enough, trusting experts or other
people to hold your money, I don't know what else is. So I guess, can you take me through the
process, if you're a pleb and you're just wanting to self-custody your keys, but with the guidance
of you guys, what would the process be like?
Sure. I mean, we have an entry-level product that ends up being about $10 a month. But really,
all you need is at least one of the popular hardware devices, whether that's Trezor, Leisure,
Coldcard. We're also rolling out support for some of the animated QR code-based devices,
and those are a bit more expensive, but I think that the user experience is totally worth it.
And just go sign up. We've got a free trial. You can also check out at keys.kasa. It's K-E-Y-S.C-A-S-A.
And it's really just a matter of following the instructions in the mobile app, plugging your
device in or doing the QR code set up. So it's really just a matter of following the instructions
at the QR code set up, and we make it a pretty seamless process to get yourself into not only
what would be considered a cold storage set up where your keys are offline,
but a distributed multiple key set up so that you're essentially eliminating single points
of failure by having your keys in multiple different locations with multiple different
types of security. Yeah, that's excellent. I know you guys have already addressed this,
but I'm not sure what the answer is. How do you guys remove yourself from the equation as
a point of failure if you guys were to become compromised or you were forced by a government
entity or a corporation to basically go against your users or your customers?
Absolutely. Yeah. If we were a single point of failure, then we'd really be no better than
any of the other exchanges or Bitcoin banks as it were. And that's one of the first things that
actually happens when you finish your initial set up with CASA is you receive a personalized
email that is a step-by-step guide to what we call the sovereign recovery process,
which is basically what are your options of if for any reason CASA ceases to exist or
stops responding, it becomes unreliable. How do you take your existing keys, your hardware devices,
and the small amount of information that you need to know really to reconstitute that setup?
And you can do that in multiple other types of Bitcoin wallets that are totally unrelated
to CASA. We have no control over them. Using them does not rely on any CASA infrastructure.
And that's one of the big benefits of us not doing anything novel and us using standards,
using third-party manufacturers that are widely used across the ecosystem is that as a result,
there are a number of different wallets out there that follow the same standards,
and you can essentially import your keys and other data into so that you can then
manage your funds in a worst case scenario, even if CASA stops working for some reason.
Yeah. That's a really important point. I guess I want to start transitioning. I know you wrote
an article back in November called, I believe it was called To Swat a Swatter. I'll post it in the
chat for our platforms, but I guess can you take us on this long journey that kind of goes about
security and safety without giving out... I don't want to give out details of the perpetrator,
which you kind of outline in the article, but can you talk about what happened,
I think a better part of five years ago, and then ultimately what the conclusion was?
Yeah. So I guess it was in... Was it October 2017? It has been over four years
when I had an incident where essentially my entire neighborhood got shut down by police and
it didn't take too long for us to uncover that it was essentially a swatting call or a prank
phone call as it were, but one that happened to say the right words, which triggered a lethal
force response from local law enforcement because they thought that people's lives were in danger.
So essentially someone claiming to me, me calling my local law enforcement and saying that I had
killed people and had hostages and bombs and all this other stuff. And so thankfully that situation
ended without incident because I wasn't even home at the time. And I ran into the police blockade
trying to get to my house. And this was obviously fortunate. And if not for that one thing,
it might have ended differently. But this actually... And I have several really long blog
posts that go into all the details, but that's actually an interesting point of operational
security that I brought up, which was that when I post things, I try not to do it in ways that would
give away exactly what I'm doing or where I am at the time. And what I believed happened that morning
is that I posted something at probably 6.30 or 7 o'clock in the morning talking about it being
Monday and it was going to be a long week. And I suspect that that's when my attacker saw that and
said, oh, he must've just gotten out of bed. So that was the perfect time to swat him.
But in fact, I was already on the other side of town at the gym because I'm a really early riser
and I like to work out early in the morning. And so it just so happens that they thought that that
was a great time to swat me and it ended up not being a great time. But fast forward a year or
two, basically I announced that I had been swatted, but didn't really say much more about the details
for nearly a year because I spent the next year basically tearing down my entire life and rebuilding
it with a focus on privacy. And I felt like one of my goals was I wanted to be able to go after the
attacker without worrying about more attacks against myself. And also I didn't want to have to completely
give up my identity and my reputation that I had already built up around it and start all over again
in order to protect my privacy. So from a privacy perspective, I kind of took the hard route there
because I wanted to keep using my real name. And yes, it is my real name. Unfortunately,
I was not smart enough a decade ago to think about creating a pseudonym.
And so then it turned into really like a four year long ordeal of talking to private investigators,
talking to a number of different attorneys, collecting tips, eventually talking to the FBI.
But it took like three years to ever get someone at the FBI's attention. And that was also just
sort of fortuitous networking connection. And after many years in handing over all the information I
collected to the FBI, it took them almost a year after receiving the information to get back
and say, hey, we found the guy. And unfortunately, the federal district attorney has declined to
prosecute because they're a minor. And apparently the federal system doesn't really have good
justice or enforcement when it comes to minors. And so they usually just sort of get off.
And so we thought it was all over at that point. But then a few months later, the state district
attorney actually came to us and said, hey, we are interested in prosecuting. And at that point,
things happened pretty quickly. The guy in question didn't contest anything. He pled guilty
to all the charges. I actually ended up flying out there and giving my own witness statement.
And he basically got probation and a handful of other terms that he has to follow by for
the next few years since he did not have a criminal record. So it was kind of a weird
conclusion. I had hoped that it had been an adult who should have known better and been able to
take responsibility for stuff. But I get it. I think we all do stupid stuff when we're kids.
It's just it's kind of crazy that we're at the point now where due to advancements in technology
and certain times when law enforcement and the justice system can't keep up with it,
you can have these really weird asymmetries. So some 14-year-old kid who knows a little bit
about tech, just enough to be dangerous, is able to actually have lethal force arbitrarily
pointed at really anybody that they want because very few people have sufficient privacy to prevent
you from being able to find their home address. And then that ends up being so difficult to have
law enforcement even care enough to try to track them down. And then even when they do track them
down, the justice system isn't really prepared to do much about it if they're just a young kid
without a record. So it's a very interesting and complicated long case. And I'm just glad to finally
have it behind me now. That's wild. There's so many threads I want to pull on here. I mean,
especially because I'm the Twitch project manager as well as the producer for this live stream.
Swatting is a pretty common occurrence. I won't say pretty common, but it's more well known in
the gaming community. When you're playing video games, you're most likely... That's really where
it started out. And then it sort of branched out into other things and now like celebrities
and politicians and now like anybody who pisses anybody off enough should worry about it.
Yeah, definitely. So like for my point of view, it's definitely an area that kind of worries me
if this can happen to quite literally anyone. So it's definitely an area that I would want
to improve on. What would you recommend for a person to start since you kind of went on this
four year long manhunt and trying to hide your identity yourself? It can be an overwhelming
or daunting task. Where would you recommend a Bitcoin plebs start with trying to improve
their privacy and security to start off the bat? Yeah. I mean, the easiest thing and what I should
have done, but in hindsight, it's hard to predict that you'll go from having a couple dozen people
following you to having hundreds of thousands of people as an audience. But of course, that's the
other thing that I think people need to understand. In the communications age, you might be a pleb
today, but tomorrow if you say or do the right or in some cases the wrong thing, then that can
attract a level of attention that you're simply not prepared for. You can essentially become a
micro celebrity if you go viral. And if you then have the attention of hundreds of thousands,
millions, tens of millions of people attracted at you, then it's just a numbers game that some
of them are going to be deranged and or willing to do things that could cause harm to you.
So really, I see it more as like anyone who participates on the public internet needs to
worry about this potential edge case, because you don't know when you might hit the lottery,
as it were, and go viral and have too much attention. And so from that perspective,
one of the easiest things to do is just not use your real name. I mean, there's obviously
benefits to using your real name. But if you think of security and privacy as complementary,
then I consider privacy to be like the outermost layer of good security. And if you can prevent
an attacker from even being able to target you in the first place, then it doesn't really matter
what the rest of your security is, though you should have good security, you should have many,
many good layers of security regardless. But the further out in the layers of security,
and then privacy that you can stop an attacker from coming at you, the better,
essentially the safer you are, the more easily you can sleep at night. So if you are participating
in discourse on social media or other public forums, especially if you're in a sort of fringe
or political space where discussions can get very heated, and people might get angry,
that is certainly a situation where I recommend using a pseudonym that can't be tied back to you.
Other than that, there is really no limit to how much time and resources
you can put into improving your privacy. I think the most important thing for people to understand
is that it's not an all or nothing thing. It can certainly feel overwhelming, especially if you
start to read some of the articles I've written about the extreme privacy things that I've
implemented. But if you do want to start going down that rabbit hole, there's a ton of good
resources. I have a privacy resources section on my website, bitcoin.page will get you there.
Though I would say the kind of privacy Bible, at least for Americans, is going to be Michael
Bazell's privacy guide, which you can find on Amazon for around $40. And he's been coming out
with a new edition of that almost every year. And each new edition adds like another 150 pages. So
I think it's up to like 400 or 500 pages at this point. And it talks about every possible aspect
of your life, and how you can implement better privacy for it. But you don't need to go to the
extreme that I did, which is creating legal entities to own all of your property. Also,
that is something that is very jurisdiction specific. It's hard to do outside of America.
But you can do things like use a VPN, you know, it doesn't take more than an hour or two for
a new person to figure out how to set up and install VPN. Install ad blockers, same thing
that that'll help protect you from just sort of everyday corporate surveillance that happens as
you're going around the internet. And I can tell you from experience, because in my pre Bitcoin
engineering life, I worked for a marketing company. And my job was to essentially write
analytics jobs that were being run across these huge clusters of data sets with, you know,
hundreds of petabytes of raw tracking information that were being collected from things like email
campaigns and website visits and whatnot. So there's a ton of data that's being collected
and there's a ton of data that you just leave strewn about the internet as you're going about
your daily life and everything that you can do to minimize that footprint or obfuscate it and make
it look like something else is going to be good. Yeah, I think Jimmy Song said, you know, in the
United States, we're addicted to free. So that's why, you know, the Facebooks, the Googles, the
YouTubes, I know they're owned by the same company, but all of those things that offer free services,
but basically you become the product. Obviously, they're selling your data and they'll take
anything they can get to marketing, to advertising. I mean, just Google, you can look up Google
AdWords. You can look up trying to run a marketing campaign on Facebook and you just see the prices.
I think that I saw numbers recently. I think it's like $150 per person per day. Maybe, you know,
that's too much, but basically it's like some absurd amount of basically their pricing,
what it's worth to sell a campaign to this subset of a population. It's normally $150 per person,
which is chum change to a lot of these big tech companies. But when you think about it in terms of
other businesses, they're just selling your privacy and your data, which is pretty absurd.
I guess if you don't pay for it, you're the product. And that's actually, we have a very
strong privacy policy at CASA that you can read on our website where we have extreme limitations
on what we'll do with any data. And more importantly is the fact that we just don't collect much data.
All you really need is an email address to get set up with us. And of course,
we happily recommend people just create a new proton mail or to denote or whatever privacy
preserving email address for that. I was going to say, I think you guys even have a service that
you can do it pseudo anonymously. Obviously, I guess it would be tied to a bank account,
or I guess you guys would accept Bitcoin. And then you could use another email to do so to pay for
that. Yep, definitely accept Bitcoin. You know, we do have data purging policies within our commerce
mechanisms as well. But, you know, if you really want to be paranoid, then you shouldn't trust
because you can't verify whether or not we've purchased any data. But if you pay us in Bitcoin,
you know that, you know, we don't have address or other financial like personal identifiable
information on you. I know, I don't know if you guys do this, but by any chance, do you guys do
a coin join as you accept Bitcoin payments? I know that's something that Francis kind of took
to the extreme because he interpreted the law with bull Bitcoin that anyone that sends Bitcoin to
his exchange, he coin joins because he said it's in order to protect his customers privacy.
Obviously, with everything going on with the freedom convoy, I'll see if they are going to
try and go after him or bull Bitcoin in general to get that information. But I know that he said that
it's in the best interest of privacy of them and their customers.
That's a good question, which I'll have to look into on our BTC pay server. I'm not sure offhand
if that's possible to do if your BTC pay server doesn't have the private keys readily available,
because I think that has a more interactive protocol. But the answer is no for right now.
But I definitely should go look into it and see what the requirements are to enable pay join
offers basically. Yeah, I didn't mean to get you guys. But I know that was something that he did,
which I thought was very clever. And I think it'd be cool for other businesses to implement going
forward. So I guess a question that I have from someone at the company is what do you think the
biggest fault is that someone can prevent in general in regards to security and privacy?
Well, it's tricky because it's like, are we talking about the most common thing or the worst
possible thing, right? There's a whole spectrum. So like I said earlier, the most common thing or
the easiest thing to prevent against is just normal day-to-day corporate surveillance.
When it comes to your regular day-to-day privacy and security, I mean, it's going to sound lame,
but really, I think one of the biggest things that people fail to do is just use a password manager
to make sure that they are generating unique passwords. Like most people that I know have
a handful of passwords that they keep in their head and they reuse them everywhere.
And that's really the best way, I think, to guarantee that you're going to get pwned at
some point because it's really the same type of problem with using credit cards is that
you're going out, you have this little bit of sensitive information, whether it's a password
or a credit card number, whatever other banking information. And as you go about your life,
you're interacting with hundreds if not thousands of third parties. And every time you have some
sort of interaction with them, you're giving them this private data. So essentially, you're
just sowing your private data all over the internet, all over the world. And it's only
a matter of time before one of those third parties gets compromised. And it doesn't really matter
if they get hacked by an external hacker or if they have an internal rogue employee that
siphons off all the data or what. It doesn't matter. It's just, once again, sort of a law of large
numbers that over a long enough period of time, that data is going to end up in the hands of an
adversarial entity. So what do you do to mitigate that risk? Well, you don't reuse data. Just like
you shouldn't be reusing Bitcoin addresses when you're receiving funds. You preferably should
not be giving your credit card data to everybody. You should not be giving the same password to
everybody. That way, if and when that data gets compromised, it's limited. It's siloed to that
one service or to that one credit card. People may be confused right now of, well, how do you
not give your credit card to everybody? Well, that's where you need to use virtual credit cards
or prepaid debit cards or whatever. I really like the privacy.com service. There's at least
half a dozen other services out there that do the same thing, where you can essentially,
just like with a password manager, generate a new credit card that then gets locked to that one
merchant. And you can even put limits and other security mechanisms on it. So that's what I really
think it comes down to, understanding how to silo off these different pieces of sensitive information
so that it's okay if they get compromised. It's really not any different than one of the major
things that we use at CASA when we're thinking about architecture, which is single points of
failure. If you're using the same password everywhere, if you're using the same credit
card everywhere, if you're using the same private key everywhere, it becomes a single point of
failure. And so that's why, once again, like with CASA, with having a distributed multi-key setup,
we did that because we understand that people are human, things happen, edge cases happen,
and you need to build a system, you need to build preferably every aspect of your life in such a way
that a failure is tolerated and can be easily recovered from. And you don't want a failure
to be potentially catastrophic. Yeah, I would completely agree with that. And even to your point
of like reusing data, I think all people or the majority of people are guilty of this, you know,
use the same passwords, whether they're your birthday, your last four digits of your social
for your pin, you know, constantly reusing the same passwords. And I know as the hackers get
the information, they get smarter too. You know, if they can tie my name, my identity, and my email
together, they're going to start using, okay, this is a password that was used in a different
database. This is his birthday. This is his pin, like last four digits of social and stuff.
I guess, what are ways that you kind of avoid, I guess you kind of brought it up there, but
even perfect example, I'm moving right now, a way to kind of try and increase my privacy, they kind
of went hand in hand, it wasn't, I'm going to do this for more privacy, but it just kind of worked
in my favor. But when I was going to set up my internet, surprisingly, you know, you call them,
you say what kind of internet connection you want, the router, the modem, all that. And they were
asking me for my social security. They wanted a credit check, didn't they? Yeah, they are not even
that. They wanted to do my social security number. And I literally stopped them. And I said, I'm not
giving you that information. And the person just kind of like stopped in his tracks. And he was
like, oh, okay, like, why not? I'm like, because I don't feel like giving that information. And we
just kept going on with the transaction, which was fine, which is the irony of it all. But yeah,
he was asking for some really private information that I didn't want to give. And luckily, for my
new home setup, I have a separate mailing address compared to my actual address. So I was okay with
giving, you know, the PO box or whatever I have as my mailing, as the address of the location I'm
going. But it was very weird. Like he asked for, yeah, the social security or the credit, yeah,
social security number and stuff. So in a way, that's more and more surveillance. What are ways
that you combat that? Yeah, so that's also that that's one of the things that can be awkward,
especially when you're new to trying to be more privacy conscious, is you start to recognize all
of the times that you interact with third parties, and they ask you for information that's just not
necessary. Obviously, they're doing this for marketing purposes, or in the case of various,
like utility and services companies, they're doing it to protect themselves from, you know,
bad credit, you know, customers that that don't pay their bills. On the service side, I found
most of the time that you can bypass credit checks, if you offer just to make a deposit,
you know, I will pay you up front, I will give you enough money that you don't have to worry
about my credit worthiness. When it comes to a lot of other merchants are especially, it's those
face to face or phone or interactions, you have the real time stuff that's more awkward, because
you know, they asked the question because it's part of their template, right? It's like it's the
company guidelines of how they need to interact with customers. And in many cases, they're just
not used to that response, because most people don't think about the consequences of giving away
all this information. And so they just will answer anything that's asked of them. And so,
yeah, you have to be willing to say that, you know, you don't give away private information
like that. And that's when it can get kind of weird, because then depending on like what their
logical branching tree of how to react to that is, then you might end up having to like, escalate
to somebody else. I've certainly had some odd roundabout interactions over the years, where
I was basically like the one guy who was asking to do something away that wasn't part of corporate
procedure. And so would have to keep pushing, keep pushing. This is where sometimes you have to be
insistent, you have to, you know, put your foot down, draw a line and basically say, look, well,
hopefully, it's not a monopoly service. Hopefully, you can say, look, I'll just, you know, have to go,
you know, call your competitor and see how they react.
Yeah, I was able to get around it. And they were okay with taking a deposit and stuff. So
I was able to get around it. But definitely when I said I wasn't giving my social, the guy just kind
of stopped in his track, then no one had ever really, or at least recently, not opted to give
their social security number, which I just thought was a big breach of privacy. And I mean, so I
think I tweeted about this, but I actually I had an issue recently, which I've had before, but where,
like I said, I don't own property in my real name. And that is an edge case that throws a number of
companies for a loop, especially insurance companies, because I start to explain that the
property is owned by a business. And then they start asking me for all the information about the
business and like revenue and stuff. I'm like, no, it's just, it's an asset holding business. And,
and most of the time they're like, oh, we, we don't know how to deal with that. And other times
though, like I know when I bought a car one time, I started going down the similar path of they're
like, this is really weird. We don't really know how to do this. And then like the guy calls his
manager over and the manager is like, oh, I've seen this once before. It's like, I know what
you're doing. Like we can, we can help you out here, but it's, it is, you do sometimes feel like
a trail blazer, which is really odd because like this should not be something that, that is like
blazing a trail just to protect your privacy. And I think it's even a weird thing that you're
almost putting a target on your back, but in the sense for security and privacy,
it's almost like they're like, they remember you because it's not a normal occurrence.
So they're like, ah, yeah, it is standing out. Yeah. That's not great. Like you, you normally,
you want to blend in with the crowd, but in my experience it can be odd, like during that initial
setup, but I think most of these people just quickly forget about you and move on.
You would hope so that, you know, they don't remember what they had for lunch or breakfast.
So they're not going to remember the transaction they have with you, but it definitely always kind
of not irks me, but I guess worries me that it's like, oh, they made a note of like, this is a
unique customer and for whatever that's worth, whether they think we're selling drugs or we own
a lot of money or, you know, for whatever nefarious reason that they would want to go after us or
learn more. That's just something that always kind of like creeps over me or worries me a little bit.
Yeah. And so, you know, if you read through a bunch of my privacy stuff, then you'll find that
really what most of this stuff comes down to is if it's not simply withholding information,
then it's using a proxy to protect your information. And a proxy can be many different
things. You know, people generally think of it in terms of internet terms and like VPNs and stuff,
and that's one kind. But in meat space, as it were, you can have other humans be proxies for you,
whether that is like for the physical mail delivery, you know, you can get a PO box,
you can get private remailers that handle your mail and then forward it wherever you want.
The sort of extreme end of this, which I have had to use a few times, is legal proxies,
where I know there was one time a utility company was really insistent that they have
like all my information. And eventually, because it was the monopoly, you know, the only utility
company, like you want electricity. What I did is I called my attorney, I said, look, you need to go
use your magical legalese to explain to this, this company, like how this stuff is going to work. And
you know, unfortunately, that can get expensive as well. But there's usually an option available.
Yeah, with unlimited time and unlimited resources, you can pretty much get anything done. I don't
know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. But I hope that it went in your favor, at least the
monopoly didn't take out harsh punishment against you. Yeah, I mean, that's, I think one of the
bad conclusions from this journey is that privacy is not cheap. Now, there are a lot of things that
you can do to protect your privacy that don't cost money, but they will always cost you at least
some sort of time. And, and, you know, learning curve that you have to get up to speed to
understand. And this is the downside to all of the defaults in various aspects of our lives, being
very poor for our privacy, is that you have to work against the grain, you have to blaze that trail
and blazing a trail is inherently hard. Because there's a lot of obstacles in your path. And so
that's why it's unfortunate that I think this is one of the reasons I'm a bit more pessimistic
on general privacy in general, is because first of all, we know that most people don't think
about it or care about it, at least until it's too late, and something has gone wrong. And then if
you do care about it and start trying to improve your own privacy, you find out very quickly that
it's, it's not necessarily easy, especially if you want to be comprehensive about it. So,
unless you're someone who's highly motivated or has had some sort of edge case attack like I have,
it seems like it's going to be relegated more to the enthusiasts and your adversarially minded
folks. Yeah, it doesn't help when the financial incentives are multi billion dollar businesses
that are in the business of selling people's information. So there's a financial incentive
in order to do so, I guess going back to like retaliation and stuff like that. So, to your
article, obviously, they're a minor, and I don't want you to give out any information on this,
they're a minor, and I don't want you to give out any information you don't feel comfortable about.
But when you went to give your testimony and statement, I'm assuming maybe you talked to
him or maybe your lawyer advised you not talk to it. Do you think this person would maliciously
do something to get back to you? Because obviously, even though the punishment might be small,
do you worry that in once he gets off his probation or whatever would come after you
in a later function, or at least attempt to? I know you've put up roadblocks and ways to try
and prevent that. No, I don't think so. I really do think that it was just a guy who, first of all,
he didn't know who I was, or at least I believe when he told me that he didn't know who I was,
that he was basically hanging out with the wrong crowd and got kind of goaded into using his skills
for this particular thing. Yeah, I'm not too worried about him. I'm just worried about
anyone else, any number of other more malicious people who might be willing to actually
use physical violence. The guys who were sitting in a basement and hanging out in
darknet forums and swapping hacks and all this other stuff. It's an interesting subculture,
but I think it's very easy if you're in that subculture to completely miss the ramifications
of the consequences of what could happen to you. Whereas it's a very different type of criminal
who is willing to say, come up to you and actually point a gun at you and use physical violence.
Because when you cross that physical threshold, they are actually putting themselves in physical
danger and it's completely obvious what the level of risk that they're taking is. So that's really
more of the criminal element than I'm worried about these days rather than the keyboard warriors.
Yeah, and it goes to your point. It's almost like you were bummed that this miner was the
one that got you and kind of it seems like he didn't know you. I guess you were kind of
hoping to get the people that gave the command or the people or person that issued the order
to go after you because it kind of seems it was kind of a step away. Probably trying to
increase their own privacy in the attack that you kind of ensued against them. I guess physical
attacks in the meat space, what would you give to a pleb that's going to a conference because
in case the listeners don't know, Bitcoin Magazine is hosting one of the biggest
and best Bitcoin conferences coming up April 6th through the 9th in Miami Beach, Florida.
I hope Jamison will be there. I know his company will be there. So excited to see some of his
employees as well as him if he's going. But how would you recommend a pleb have security
and privacy at a conference like this? Well, I mean, the first thing you have to
understand is that criminals in the area are going to know that this is happening.
And in fact, I believe there was at least one case last year of a guy who got in a taxi and
the taxi driver basically asked for his phone and was starting to screw around with it. And
you gave the impression that he was like trying to open up his wallets and steal his money. So
you just have to be vigilant and understand that this conference, because of its size and
publicity, it's going to attract attention. And so if you're going to the conference,
maybe when you're not physically at the venue, don't wear crypto stuff that makes you stand out.
Definitely don't be walking around with large sums of money that are easily accessible.
You should not have a hot wallet on your phone that has thousands or tens of thousands. I mean,
I've seen people who had hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single signature
wallet on their phone because they just left it there for so many years and never bothered to
move it off. But consider the fact that you yourself can be a single point of failure.
I talk about wrench attacks and physical attacks, a decent amount, though they are very rare.
Most likely, the 99.9% of people who attend the conference will not have anything bad happen to
them. However, just due to how many people are there and the fact that crime has certain rates
of things that happen, probably will have one or two people who have a bad experience. A lot of
this stuff, security, privacy, whatever, I think of it in terms of insurance, in that you know that
bad things happen in the world, and a lot of them are fairly rare. And so the question comes down to
how much of your time and resources are you going to invest to insure yourself against one of these
edge cases? And just doing something as simple as not walking around with Bitcoin logos all over
you when you go out to the nightclub where you might get something slipped in your drink. I think
that's a pretty simple ask. It doesn't take a lot of resources to do. But yeah, don't be stupid.
I mean, you just need to make sure that you aren't attracting attention, and understand that if for
some reason you do attract attention, that you need to be able to mitigate what the possible
downsides are. Yeah, I know some people don't have street smarts, and I'm not the most intimidating
dude standing at a stature of like five, six. So I'm not the scariest or biggest dude on the street,
but definitely, to your point, kind of be street smart. If you can avoid wearing Bitcoin merchandise
or even talking about it, say that you're in the financial sector. If you're out of the bar,
don't say you work for a Bitcoin company. I'll definitely say I work in a media company, and
I'll probably get harassed for saying I'm spreading bad news, and I'll go with that, saying I'm
mainstream media, but they don't have to know it's for a Bitcoin company. Yeah, and I think that's
pretty important. So Jamison, I think we're getting to the end of the time that I had you.
I don't want to keep you, because I know you're quite busy with your day job and running a company.
So is there anything else that you'd like to send off our listeners with?
Just not to let it get to your head, right, is that I talk about bad things happening all the time,
but I've also been on the front lines of helping people self-custody their funds for many, many
years, and so I've seen really some of the worst case scenarios. They're still very rare, but I
think that they're useful data points, and they're learning lessons, and a lot of the decisions that
went into how we've architected CASA and how we continue to develop the product are based upon
very hard-earned decisions that people have really learned the hard way over the years,
sometimes through catastrophic loss or just having a really, really bad time as a result of
one particular decision that was made. So there's, like I said, an overwhelming level of things that
you can learn or dive into, but also there's no rush. You have plenty of time. You can start small,
spend a few hours on the weekend just digging into some of the easier stuff, and just doing that,
just investing a few hours into your security and privacy will already put you ahead of 98%
of other people in the world, and that's one of the other major factors when it comes to security
in a variety of different ways is you don't have to have perfect security. You just have to have
better security than the guy next to you. It's kind of like the old adage about you don't have
to be able to outrun the bear. You just have to be able to run faster than the other guy. It's
because we know there will be criminals, there will be malicious people out there trying to attack
people, and if you think from their perspective, they're looking for the soft targets. They want
to get the best return on their investment, and so if they look at you, well, preferably you'd make
it so they don't even look at you in the first place, but if that fails and they look at you,
and they're also looking at any number of other targets, then you want them to just look at you
and say, no, that looks like it's going to be too much trouble. I'm going to try to attack that
other person instead. Yeah, thanks. I think that's a really good point, and thanks so much for coming
on the show. It's been a pleasure talking with you, and I look forward to seeing you in Miami,
as well as a bunch of your employees that work there. So, everyone, we're going to get ready to
go to a commercial break, and then I'll be back right after that, and we'll be prepping for the
deep dive that's going to go on in spaces. Catch you in a few.
What is up, everyone? How's it going? So, we've got a little bit of time before we go into the
deep dive. Thanks for hanging out with us. If you have any questions, definitely throw them in the
chat for YouTube or Twitch, and I'll make sure to answer them. In the meantime, I'll be putting up
some earned carrot codes, and we can talk through some of the things about the conference. If you
guys have not gotten your tickets already, you definitely have to go to b.tc forward slash
conference and use the code ytmag for 10% off your tickets. Tickets will be going up in price on
Friday at midnight, so make sure to get them if you haven't before then. Also, hotels are being
booked up pretty quickly, and I know plane tickets are going up in price as well. As the event gets
closer, there will be a couple other events unrelated to Bitcoin Magazine and the Bitcoin
Conference going on in Miami that will probably have a larger inflow of people into the city of
Miami and Miami Beach, so make sure to definitely get your tickets today. I'm going to start putting
up some earned carrot codes, and I know CK, Sam Ruhl, and The Rational Root will be joining us
momentarily to talk through the deep dive and some of the charts that they will be going through
on the deep dive. So, while I'm setting that up, putting up the earned carrot code right now. Give
me one sec. So, make sure the earned carrot app is up on screen right now. If you guys don't have
that, that is Bitcoin Magazine's app, and that you can use to earn sats. You can read articles
in order to get sats, and we also give them out during the show. So, that is the QR code to download
the app, and I'm putting up the code right now. Okay, let me refresh. There we go, and now I'm
going to go to the chat. In the meantime, anything. Advise folks to buy Bitcoin with new fresh fiat,
not shoveling and shoveling the same old money. Just keep the buzz of the Bitcoin system. Yeah,
I like that. If you can get some fiat, whether it's cash for doing hard labor, and then kind of
use that in order to buy Bitcoin. Also, I know when people go to meetups, a lot of times people
are willing to buy Bitcoin with cash. It's more of a privacy transaction. You're using Bitcoin
normally peer-to-peer, where they use it with a lightning network transaction or across on chain.
You're doing a peer-to-peer transaction, and it's very hard for someone to track. They're
sending from your address to hopefully a newly given address for it, and then also you're just
giving them cash, which is more discreet and private. Anything else from the Twitch?
Just add the ETH button. Come back, Jack. Yeah, no. Oh, Twitter just added the ETH button. Oh,
eww. That is disgusting. I know they added NFTs. I thought they added ETH a while ago, which obviously
I'm not about, but Jack leaves and they start doing all these altcoin things, which I'm not about.
So it's also expanding. I know that they also... Wow, where am I going with this? The Canadian
Convoy, and I know obviously Trudeau was labeling everyone as domestic terrorists, or at least
calling them terrorists, and they're going after the financial means in order to go after these
people in the Freedom Convoy or anyone that supported it. I know that obviously they shut
down, give, send, go, as well as GoFundMe, pulled the donations, and then they were just doing a
full return. Obviously Tallycoin, which is the platform for raising Bitcoin for donations.
I'm not going to oust the founders because I know that they are busy with stuff. CK is joining us
in a sec, but obviously they're trying to go after the founders of Tallycoin. They told
Twitter a few days ago that they moved the funds, not to them, to a private entity to distribute
the funds to the truckers. I think that was a great move in hindsight, or even before it was
announced, the Emergencies Act in Canada, in order to protect them and their selves and their
families from having repercussions. Whether that there's repercussions in court later on remains
to be seen. Some people were saying on Twitter, and I wasn't able to verify this, that their names
were listed and that the Canadian government, or I guess the financial institution there, was going
to try and name them in the case against them for helping the Canadian truckers, but that remains
to be seen. How's it going, CK? I know you just joined.
What is up? How are you doing, Chris? Excited for this show.
Yeah, a man in the ship here. I was just kind of talking about the conference. CK, I know you can
talk about it for days and days, so anything you want to expand on?
We just announced Jordan Peterson, y'all. Legend, he's getting into the Bitcoin space,
and rightfully so, and he's going to be at the event, so extremely excited for that.
Yeah, I think that was tough keeping close to the chest. I think you and I and a lot of people
that work in for the team knew, but we weren't allowed to announce it until it was officially
made public. Sorry, guys, for not lying to you, but withholding information about the conference.
I hope we have more big-name speakers like him and other ones joining in recent weeks.
We're only 49 days away from the conference. Can you believe that, CK?
Dude, it brings a lot of anxiety to me, but it's coming. It's coming full steam ahead.
There's nothing stopping the conference. The days just keep ticking away, and I am excited
for it to happen. I don't like to say I want it to be over. I'm excited for it to happen,
and that feeling that you get in your chest when you know the conference is successful
is the best feeling ever, so I am excited to put on the best Bitcoin conference for all the
Bitcoiners out there. I know CK and are going to be quite busy at the conference when it's going on.
I'm just hoping I can enjoy it, and I hope it doesn't end in a blink of an eye, even though
I know that's going to be the case. Anything in particular that you're looking forward to,
I know last night I was saying there's a couple of things I'm excited about.
Or why I'm bullish as of late.
Oh, man. So much. We're throwing a motherfucking music festival. That's part of the conference,
so that is unreal in and of itself. I'm just so excited to just meet Bitcoiners. Last time,
just left and right people were just pointing me out, and like, hey, what's up, CK? Just such
an awesome feeling. I'm going to be giving away copies of the sovereign individual like I did
last time around at the conference, so I think I brought eight copies. I just smashed them into
my suitcase and made it happen, and I gave away all eight copies, so I'll probably do that again
as well. There's nothing better than meeting Bitcoiners, hanging out with Bitcoiners, getting
to hug and shake hands and just chat with all the people that you've been rubbing shoulders with
virtually on Twitter and stuff like that. Yeah. I feel horrible saying this, but are the
authors of the sovereign individual still alive? I know it was two authors.
One of them is still alive. Yeah. Lord Rees-Mogg is still alive.
We should try and get him to the conference.
Yeah, no. I think we've definitely been reaching out to him to do content, and he's not taking
very many interviews these days.
Okay. That's a bummer. But I mean, he obviously wrote a great book, or at least the book that
is beloved by Bitcoiners alike. I will say it's a tough read. I know you like it. It's a tough
read for sure. It's not easy. But like most things like Bitcoin, it's not easy. It's getting
easier, but it takes a lot of responsibility and self-sovereignty to do things.
Yeah, no, absolutely. If you don't mind giving me a sec, I am going to go... So we are simul-streaming
this What the Fuck is Up with the Bitcoin Price with Root and Sam from the Deep Dive team on
Twitter spaces as well as on this YouTube live stream. So I need to get that set up really
quickly and get that launched. But yeah, if you don't, excuse me, Chris, I'm going to jump to do
that. Maybe it'd be a good time to tell people a few more details about some speakers. I know
we've been releasing panels as well. I don't know if you have any of that information handy.
Yeah, I can definitely look that up. And while CK is getting the spaces all set up, I'll pull
it up. I don't want to reveal anything that isn't revealed yet. So I'll just go to the
conference website where you can also get your tickets. And ticket prices are going up in two
and a half days. So I'll just go to the conference website where you can also get your tickets.
So ticket prices are going up in two and a half days. So Friday at midnight, the prices go up.
So the only thing that is more scarce than Bitcoin is Bitcoin conference tickets, April
6th through the 9th in Miami Beach, Florida. It is going to be an absolute blast. Speaking of
scarcity, I know CK brought this up yesterday on spaces for the FAQ spaces. Hotel rooms are
So to make sure to get those as well as to get your plane tickets, there will be a couple other events that are going on for the there's a couple other events unrelated to Bitcoin magazine and the conference that will be going on at the same time.
So obviously those events will be looking to try and get hotels and planes down there.
Yeah, so there's, we have different levels of passes so the first level of pass is the GA pass.
So that was general admission that will get you into the conference, April 7 and eighth. That is obviously the general conference that's going on you'll see a lot of the big name hitters whether it's President Bukele of El Salvador, Michael
Starr, Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs, Jack Mallers, Dr. Joe Jorgensen, JB Sears, you know we just announced Jordan Peterson so it's excited to have him to the cast.
Next up will be the industry pass. So that gives you access to the whole conference so the industry day on the first day, April 6, the general admission seven and eight, the sound money music festival the first and only sound money music festival.
I'm not going to make this a thing going forward or tradition, but it's a fully sound music thing and there was a great question from the FAQ asking about if there will be other altcoins or cryptocurrencies we are Bitcoin only and Bitcoin only company
in the conference. So it's a single strike rule meaning that if they bring up anything regarding any other cryptocurrencies it's one and done, and they will not ask to partake in it going forward. That sounds a little harsh but it's we wanted about Bitcoin
and Bitcoin only.
So, you know, maybe there'll be some cool things with doing Bitcoin at the show whether it's using lightning tipping, or even, I know that there are ways to do NFTs on Bitcoin. I'm not an NFT guy but if it's on Bitcoin I'm all for it.
So, yeah, we've got so many great people coming up and I know CK will be said will be announcing more great people as well.
I hope you guys are all enjoying this stream CK is getting up the live stream, or the spaces on Twitter right now. But you guys are in the best spot ever. And why is that because this is YouTube or Twitch.
I know my Twitch people, I love the Twitch people but we have a promo called called why TMAG for 10% off your tickets, and they're at a discount because Friday, they go up in price so make sure to get them.
And I forgot to mention the last two tickets as well. We have a whale pass that's all encompassing all food, drinks, alcohol, transportation to and from the conference and the hotel, the best seating in the house you can see when President
Trump makes his secret announcement that he said on Twitter a few weeks ago, as well as Jack Mallers saying he's orange pill the world and saying a million more nations have joined, as well as the fireside chat
and it's here.
So I'm really really looking forward to that as well.
So the well passes get you everything you know the best seats in the house, as well as all that. And then we have the sound money music festival for people that are in Miami or would just like to come for the show I think it's going to be a site to be seen,
it's gonna be really really interesting.
Yeah, is there any other questions from chat now. Okay, we're getting this started.
We're going and route is already in there but we're still waiting on Mr Sam, he has actually one more minute before the start of the programming but route I guess, if you want, why don't you introduce yourself to both the Twitter audience and the spaces audience.
I'll actually unmute real quick and I'll say that again.
All right, so while we wait for Sam, we are going to introduce route to the audience route why don't you unmute yourself and introduce yourself.
Hey guys, thanks for having me on route on chain analyst.
I like to look at, well, Bitcoin cycle analysis and on chain analysis is what I do. I like to get to the root of things. And yeah, thank you so much for for having me on.
Absolutely, I love that getting to the root of things and some of my favorite parts of your analysis is how creative you are with trying to look at the data that is around Bitcoin. Can you talk about a couple of like the unique, you know, visualizations
and metrics that you use in your analysis.
Yeah, sure. So I have looked at, well, I started off with just looking at cycles so comparing the different Bitcoin cycles.
You know, people have aligned them before from the having obviously.
So I came up with some different concepts to look at it to also look at it from the previous autumn high and and now you see the charts all over the place but that was in the beginning.
I made some spiral charts. I didn't come up with the spiral concept, but I surely worked upon it further. Also to look at it at the spiral chart for example in terms of blocks instead of just time.
And so those are some of the creative things I like to do. And soon I hope to come with, with even some more cool stuff. I cannot really talk about that yet but there is a model that's coming up.
Hopefully next week or so I can share it so I'm excited for that as well.
All right, y'all. Well, we have Sam rule in the house we have root in the house. This week we will not have Dylan Leclerc he is busy filming actually with Bitcoin magazine up in Vermont.
But more coming from Dylan later. But thankfully, route is coming into fill in Dylan's huge foot footsteps.
And he is definitely well suited to bring some really awesome analysis. Sam has set a pretty awesome agenda for us. But I want to give a quick show to everyone about the deep dive.
I know you and Dylan work really hard every single day, putting out some of the most cutting edge alpha around what is happening with the Bitcoin market you look at derivatives you look at market sentiment you're looking at macro macro forces, you're
looking at main data, this is really a 360 analysis type of a deep dive, Sam do you want to talk a little bit about, or add on to, you know what you're doing each day for the deep dive.
Sure. Just like you said Dylan and I are working at this every day, try to publish kind of a daily weekday issue on what's going in on the Bitcoin market that can be everything from futures ETF to public miners analysis to price action to on
price action data just trying to take a 360 view like you said, we publish you know weekday content for paid subscribers about one issue a week for free subscribers here so you're just interested in checking it out, or you want to get some more Bitcoin market
intelligence in your inbox center for the free tier. It's on subset you can see the link in my Twitter Dylan's.
And this is what we're doing all the time and just trying to deliver you know good quality content and research about how the Bitcoin market structure works.
Yep, and actually last month, they dropped a 30 page monthly report, which is pinned to the top. And if you follow the link in the pin tweet.
That's the free tier and you'll be able to get that PDF monthly which is absolutely just incredible so really great job, Sam and Dylan on that. Sam, I guess, let's just jump into the topics I know the first one that you had teed up here is talking
about the latest price action and overall market thoughts. I personally you know I'm unsure of where we are it seems like big coins more relevant than ever but obviously price action doesn't always follow that.
We have really really smart people that think we're in a bear market and that we're going to be grinding down. I'm curious what you in route are thinking, I'll pass it off to you Sam and then maybe root can chime in.
Yeah, I'll share this stuff you know you're thinking about all the time about this much broader market and where it's headed in a lot of uncertainty and I think, you know, the way I've been leaning into analysis is try to understand the macro uncertainty
there as much as possible which, you know, kind of saw from Bitcoin price in Q4. After this run up to new all time highs, whether it's this kind of end of the year gain loss selling kind of risk off out risk off appetite increasing portfolio
balancing allocations Bitcoin just like the rest of the markets equity markets included went down. And so, you know, now the regime that we're headed into from a macro regime for this year is not a promising one for Bitcoin outlook so you have these
new colliding forces where you have really strong fundamentals, but you have a macro outlook now that's, you know, we'll see if inflation peaks anytime soon but growth declining that puts this tough backdrop on Bitcoin, and I think that you know the cycle
this time around we can get into cycles talking I know roots a lot of work on that previously.
I'd like to see you know here we look at arranging consolidation phase equities correlations is still heavily strong it's good to see the, you know, lately, and we got some charts we can pull up to after we go through some intros but you know Bitcoin
is really getting hit going down 30 40% two times on a 30 day percent change and then you see some good demand buying that into so I think you might have had, you know, some macro sellers and Q4 reallocate sell off some Bitcoin and what's left is some really strong
fundamentals.
That is the key word, like over the next two months or what you know we seem to be in a waiting holding period for what the macro is going to do with March rate hikes coming up.
Okay, I can maybe jump in here so I, I'm unmuted right yeah. So I, I think.
Yeah, I kind of agree with, with Sam's analysis. I think the situation we are currently in is most comparable to the 2019 run we had and then we had it like we went to 14 K and then we had a drop in terms of on chain analysis I think we're in a very
comparable situation with that, with that one. And so, so I think there's a lot of macro uncertainty. There was actually also in that time because we got the corona crash just then.
And that brought us back to, to a low. And so I have some on chain floor indicators that I look at. One is an intermediate indicator, and that's around 36 K, and then there is like really a floor, which is at 29 currently.
And it depends a bit so I expect to get to this intermediate floor, let's say, it's called the mezzanine actually.
And it's quite likely that we might touch upon it, we don't have to in the next days or even in the next week or two weeks or something, but it's quite likely that at some point we will still touch upon that level again, that level is also it rises, it goes a bit along with price action.
So only, I would say in terms of if we get like a black swan event. Let's say the war with Russia, you know with with Ukraine, if that if stuff like macro uncertainty, you know increases if we got like a panic in the stock market in equities as well,
then surely that will correlate with Bitcoin and I think we can drop to the floor which is at at 29 currently. Now, I do think actually the lowest in like in terms of like on chain.
If we look there's many indicators will will get into several as well in a bit.
There's many on chain indicators that indicate that we have been at a macro low short term holder supply is one of them. And so I actually do think the macro low is in, we're just in kind of this, you know choppy price action situation I think we're going to
kind of range a bit between 47 K which is, you know, the, the short term holder cost basis, which is a level that sure might give some resistance and, you know, in the next week or so.
So I think we're kind of going to range between 47 K and maybe 36 you know for for some weeks, maybe even until March before but but in the meantime we're kind of building up this, this solid basis, you know with because the demand of short term holders
is slowly coming back. And, you know, it takes time we are a little bit in bear market conditions, for sure if you look at on chain and but but it looks like this bottom is in and that we're slowly getting out of it, so it will take some time we will probably
have some, some swings up and down still, you know, as I said within that range, and, and that's for me, basically the base case and I would expect like at some point maybe even a little bit before, you know or mid March or so or if not at the end of March,
I would expect that that Bitcoin can, you know, if we can recover this short term holder cost basis, then, yeah, we can get really higher prices from there on, but, but we're kind of at the start of a new cycle in my opinion.
I mean you can look at it from different perspectives, you can look at it as like a lengthening cycle if we all believe the top is not in yet if we believe that hundred gay at least this coming or so.
Before next having, you can look at it two ways you can look at it like as a lengthening cycle that we're now currently again in this in a sort of mini bear market again, you know, like, but I would argue and I've put a chart on that out and we'll probably
discuss that a bit later as well, is that we're kind of in a new cycle, basically if you look at the supply dynamics on chain. It looks like we're kind of starting a new cycle overall, but it's kind of the same outcome right like I would expect still to reach
at least at least levels of 100 K before next having, but, but yeah we will see we will go with the data. And yeah, maybe we can get into some charts.
Yeah, speaking of charts would love to get into some charts and for everyone who's watching or listening on spaces. I pinned to the top the link to go to the live stream we where we are live streaming.
You can go and see roots cute little mascot here, and you can also go check out the charts we're going to walk through.
But honestly, it's way better to see root here on YouTube versus on Twitter spaces so really recommend porting over to that, but Sam I don't know if you have some charts handy that you, you want to jump into right away here.
I guess you have something ready or, but in general, I do kind of agree with you route that we are at this kind of. We're at a critical point here where are we going to find out if this is, in fact, a longer cycle and the top is yet to come,
or if we have entered into the next cycle, and you know the previous top was 69 K or something like that.
Sam I see you're showing a chart here you want to take over.
Yeah, yeah, we've just got some charts here we can run through and you know we take the kind of conversation wherever you know I'm no technical analyst by any means when I look at price to do some but kind of hold a lot more analysts in high regard of what
they can do there. But quickly what this is looking at in terms of when we just think of like price and context and some of these moves.
This is 30 day change in Bitcoin price, and I've got a legend here it says bottom other top those aren't necessarily no perfect conditions of saying hey this is a top this is a bottom or other.
It's really just looking at this 30 day percent change in price, kind of the average around there, you know, nine to 12% through the mean, and then looking at like having an overextension of that the top when you have these explosive Bitcoin moves up.
And then something to the bottom as well. So I think what's really curious in this sense is, although, you know, this might, you know, emphasize that maybe the macro uncertainty point kind of what we've seen a little bit more in Q4 is that you know we have
multiple 30 day price changes below, you know, minus 15% over the last few months. And one, the latest being 31% starts to look like a pretty attractive period if you're an investor on the sidelines and looking at Bitcoin and saying what you know what's a good
price when everything, you know, particularly oversold but kind of that drawdown the previous ones were, you know, July 2021 which we had massive liquidation cascades price moves 43% almost in over 30 days.
The code crash, we have 52% so pretty significant over the last you know three or four years to see that as like a top four drawdown in terms of price, which I think at the same time, you know, when you look at the demand side, we've seen some fund inflows
pick up different ways that you can, you know, measure whale buying you see some accumulation and demand there, you know, apart from other news stories we get of other people picking up Bitcoin. So that latest drawdown seems like a pretty attractive price
where people got at 34 35,000 seems to be a little bit more demand there didn't reach kind of 30,000 lows that we saw before.
So just kind of an interesting point there. And then I'll just touch on, you know, let's see if I get to the next slide here, just looking at like mega one day percent changes so yeah in price when you look at just day every day change so for a long
period through q4 didn't see in terms of like major volatility moves. And then you get this huge drawdown period to the bottom side that's quickly kind of accumulation is built up or demand is built up there.
So, just some interesting observations for you know, kind of price change demand over the last three months.
Did you see a bit of these slides that Sam just went over.
What I already said earlier that kind of this macro bottom seems to be in, you know, you can see that this, this last you know the the blue the dark blue zone, let's say, at the last drop which kind of indicates that this bottom is in also from, you know,
price change perspective. I think, yeah, there's, there's several, you know, online, several on chain indicators that that you know there's confluence with those indicators and in terms of this.
And so, so yeah I think we see it kind of at many. If we look at things from from this like more TA perspective, or even from the fundamental expected perspective we get to like similar conclusions that that it quite looks like this bottom is in and,
and another way to look at this is that, you know, again to to say like why wouldn't we drop like further or so. We also have to keep in mind that we had like a distribution top and not a blow off top this time.
And so the downside also seems to be less you know and there's a lot of, you know, the derivative market has a big influence as well on the market during the bull market we saw that there was a lot of leverage, you know, going into,
instead of spot, you know, derivatives were being used, and we see that now also in the bear market, and in the in these bear, a bit of more bear bearish conditions that that that derivatives are playing a role so there's less.
You know there's the risking which happens in the in the derivative markets, instead of in the spot. And so this. This is also another reason why I think, you know, that the that the low is likely in, and you know that we that we that we don't have
to expect a deep drop like like for example as in the in the corona crash which you can see like the minus 52% and now we're, we have had like the minus, you know, 31% almost.
So, so I think, yeah, unless we got a black swan as I said, we can reach those kind of similarities still with with the corona event.
Otherwise, I think, yeah, it's more likely, you know, doesn't mean that it cannot happen everything we look at probabilities all the time, but my base case would be definitely that the lowest end which which also seems to reflect in this chart.
Yeah, totally and I don't have the chart here, but we've shown that derivatives kind of funding chart very color coded before in terms of what we saw in like the April, kind of June July area where you have kind of over long leverage liquidations
and then you have an over period of, you know, short liquidation, the market is over long and it's over short and inflating price and it's deflating price.
And now we've seen kind of like over the last, you know, one to two months we've seen this like slow winding down a little bit of leverage, leaving the system and overall everything is more market neutral so I would say when you think about case the macro
on chain derivatives driving I would, you know, in my head I would say okay, really subject to macro conditions now on chain fundamentals kind of second behind that and derivatives don't look too overextended, like they had when we were at kind of previous April top.
But we can get into some of the on chain stuff. This kind of goes along with a little bit of price changes and kind of on chain sentiment and we can get into some other kind of macro on chain indicators, some interesting ones that we're looking at talk about bottoms
so what I'm showing here is just spent output profit ratio, so for if you're familiar with on channel you've seen it by familiar with this metric. It's really calculated as price sold over price paid so just looking at when the market is in, you know, kind of
the state is it taking profit is it taking loss it's looking at seven day moving average here and I got two charts here just breaking it down into two groups short term holders and long term holders.
And so you know what's interesting about this one is typically you know we in these kind of bottom market events we go through, you know, people realizing more losses or realizing a lack of profit other profit or loss below that.
So here you know you have the market realizing kind of in previous downturn in terms of June, you know, upward a couple percent during the code crash upwards of like four or 5% realizing in the market.
And so now we've kind of come from this bottom where people were selling Bitcoin realizing it out of loss, kind of a total aggregate level, and we're back to this kind of like state of profit so first back over 1.0, which is typically been a positive sign of the
this stains and we can talk about it between the two different groups.
But I don't know about you, I see this as you know generally a positive sign right now that we've kind of out of this short term holder maybe capitulation selling some losses still below the on chain cost basis like you mentioned from 47,000 or so.
But kind of easy landing or soft spot right here we're at right now.
Exactly. So the short term holder soper is especially, you know, more on the to look at the the the short shorter timeframe as well.
So I, it's like more an early sign let's say I've actually used this chart for my for this week's analysis of BTC direct as well.
I, I was looking at this as well and yeah so so super, you know, we tend to bounce off one during a bit of like bullish, you know periods and we reject off of one during like the bearish periods.
And it's kind of it's a good indicator to to find like local bottoms and local tops you know like in the market. And so, so the short term holder soper, but, but as well as the as the as the just regular soper.
It's now so it looks at the, I basically add an aggregate of all transactions of the day, and if they are in profit or in a loss you know like on average. And so if they're above one they're in profit.
And that's why it tends to be, you know, it tends to bounce off one during during bullish periods and reject off of one in bearish periods as I said, because this is, you know, in a bearish periods, when we get to one.
People that hold that transaction get break even. And so then they tend to sell, you know, and that's why we reject off of one you know and and the opposite is true and bull market conditions so so in bull market conditions.
Which means kind of that that the profit is has reset to zero, and that's often a sign that we go back up. So, so the, the positive thing I mean here at this chart we look relatively zoomed out but if you zoom would zoom in a little bit more.
We kind of had like a bounce off one, just a very small one. So it's it's a little early to say that we're back in a bit more bullish period, but, but we had this, this small bounce off of one, which is generally a good sign we have to see if it, if it.
If it doesn't reject you know in the next few days but if we, if we go up a little more even in the next days or so, I would say, yeah, that's a very good sign again that this that the bottom is in.
So, so yeah, nice chart.
Yeah, and then it kind of the other side of that too I mean short term holders, kind of long term holders think long term holders are kind of a more interesting trend when you're looking at kind of spent output profit ratio in terms of a lot of distribution,
or kind of local tops when you see like an extended period of profit taking so you kind of look at the bottom chart here, kind of long term holder so you're looking at, you know, kind of this peak and when we were in 2021 around April, you're seeing you know
long term holders on average in the market realizing upwards of you know 700% in the market on a seven day moving average, which really kind of marks the peak of the cycle here as long term holders are, you know, selling their distributing their taking profits
and then you kind of run out of kind of new demand buyer demand so it kind of gets exhausted.
And then we have kind of across all again but what's interesting is you know we have a lot of profit taking during that period. Back to our most recent high very small, very muted in terms of what we saw before.
So, you know, I take this and have been for a while long term holders just generally looking and and having hold their conviction and we can talk about a little bit more looking for higher prices where their kind of cost basis is now, or the price they paid.
And then we just got a little annotation here spike in it when when different next had kind of hacked coins seized.
So you see that little bit on chain movement there but mostly kind of muted in terms of overall, you know, profit taking what we see from long term holders right now.
I just want to jump in again and encourage everyone, this is brought to you by the deep dive all the charts that we are discussing are viewable via YouTube if you click on the first pin tweet you can go watch this on YouTube and see the charts that we're referring to
all of the charts that we're discussing were created by Sam and Dylan Leclerc, and they put on the deep dive every single day to pay subscribers and they also do a weekly email for free subscribers, and they, you know, put together all this incredible
information on a weekly and monthly basis. So really, really incredible stuff. So go jump over to YouTube, check it out. Go check out the deep dive you can sign up by going to Sam's profile and clicking on our welcome link in his pin to his, his info.
So, go do that real quick and yeah I guess Sam let's just let's keep rolling with what's happening with the price and these these charts.
Cool. Yeah. Why don't we jump into a couple on chain cycle indicators, and just talk through like, you know, where they're at where they've been in previous cycles, some ones that you know I'm kind of looking at right now we can share on his thoughts on
some of the ones he's looking at paying attention to. Obviously one of the biggest ones in terms of on chain Don and I are tracking you know somewhere 2025 kind of key on chain metrics and we're trying to look at those how they've historically performed
in different cycles and where we're at today. So this one I'm showing is just market value of a realized value and then there's z score version of that which is just value over means some statistical normalization to give a little bit better signal
in the metric, but really what this says you know you can look at market value same price around 44,000 or market cap around 860 billion over realized value which is kind of that on chain cost basis net so we talked about short term holders having, you know,
an on chain cost base of 47,000 to include long term holders that brings you know you realize cost basis your value down to 24,000 you can think about a market gap terms around, you know, kind of 460 billion so it's really just a ratio of those two, probably
one of the most popular on chain metrics look at things a lot of value in this one but in this particular one what we look from like previous cycles we have these like blow off parabolic type moves and these tops and then you have the extended downturns
kind of the market value or price even reaches below realized value and those become, you know, pretty kind of generational buying opportunities when that happens historically.
And what we get this time as we get price kind of overheated to the upside but not near as much as what we saw in previous cycles and then every time prices essentially try to cool off and reach back down to that cost basis and the last two price downturns.
So we're kind of stepping in to buy into that and so, and I'll just emphasize you know these colors, a little bit more of a subjective way, although grounded in some objectivity to to kind of do this help people give a good idea of different parts of cycles
how we look at it so this is just based on, you know, percentile analysis where we look at the value today relative to historical percentile and then we just put some thresholds around that based on history so in this particular case.
This is overcooled really dark green here in MVR VZ score is below its 15th percentile, and then kind of overheated is above 98 percentile so one that you know right now points to kind of more of a neutral market standing, you know, fits with that you know in this
consolidation ranging phase looking to see what catalyst move, where we go next.
I'll pass it to you. Yeah, I'll jump in. So, yeah, I really love this, this on chain metric market value against realize values, a very useful tool and my opinion.
Yeah, you can clearly see in this chart that you know we never got to like the overheated, the truly dark red, and let's say, but so so therefore again, you know, I would stress that that we also will not get to the overcooled you know like so it goes both
ways you know if we don't have the extreme upside we don't have the extreme downside.
And so I'm not saying we will not not get a blow off top again in the future, you know, but but the market has been maturing a bit I mean the size of the market is bigger, you know derivatives are now a part of the market which, you know, maybe
it's just, it's more reasonable to assume more of distribution tops and also less severe bottoms. From now on, like, things could change there are some theories, you know, maybe on on on why we would maybe perhaps get blow off tops in the future.
But, but for now it seems we're in this, in this phase where, where we kind of have just more of distribution tops and and less severe bottoms. So, so again like, yeah, only like a black swan event I would expect us to get like to this overcooled,
you know, you know colors but but otherwise I would think like just the cool, the green cool colors are are good enough of a bottom. And again if you compare it to the 2019 run up which you know was, you know, from 3k to 14k let's say.
It also was not as much of a blow off top. And there, you know, it was also kind of a little bit more distribution top and and there we actually also just got back to this to again to a similar level that we are now, you know, at just the cooled level.
Only the corona drop took us to like overcooled levels but if corona wouldn't have happened. I think we would have stayed in just the lighter green colors there as well. So, so this is a discharge again shows shows this basically.
Yeah, there's a lot of confluence along many of the on chain indicators which which kind of showed this narrative.
Yeah, no and I love the point to that if you don't have this blow up type top you don't have that volatility the upside, then you know certainly less likely to get that downside potential as well.
We can go into another one here just got a few here to kind of talk through and kind of same pattern percentile analysis around these on chain indicators.
One particular is coin days destroyed, and it's, you know, the 90 day cumulative view of that so just a refresher, people don't know, you know, coin day destroyed would be let's say one Bitcoin sat in an address for 100 days.
And then when that is transacted or moved from that address, or we see movement in that coin, essentially have 100 days coin days destroyed then.
So it takes into account when you have kind of these longer holder coins that have been around for a long time let's say it's very small amount of Bitcoin but it's been around for, you know, 1000 days and hasn't moved.
So when it moves it has a higher amount of coin days. And so we look for that activity is saying you know, is there a lot of distribution and some of these older coins that are moving or is there a lot more maybe non movement or accumulation that's happening
when you look at coin days destroyed so if you're to look at this chart and say, just a coin day destroyed on a specific day doesn't give you a lot of insight but if you aggregate it over 90 days it gives you a good picture of kind of like where the short term trend is.
And so, you know, a big thing that we see now in terms of our previous top that we hit. We saw a lot more older coin activity. And that's, you know, confluent with a lot more profit taking and long term holder groups we see a lot more activity on the
top where you're seeing older coins come alive and sell take profits, do that at the top. And that top are referring to around like April 2021 and then you see us make a new all time high top but you see much less coin movement here, like you see much more
activity from long term holders, you see a lot less distribution. Again, you know, signaling, you know, this is the case where the market is not overheated at these price levels based on the activity of kind of long term holders and points to again that
right now. The conviction is looking for more kind of higher prices before distributing a lot more of those coins would, you know, comment to this is relying on like new demand coming in as well so you know if we have a lackluster group of new demand
that you're probably not going to see, you know, pushing up higher prices or heavy distribution there either.
Yeah, so, so, yeah, this is also great chart. I, I think, yeah, what's very interesting is that we made a new all time high you know during this heavy accumulation, and it's, it's basically the first stop we had was based on hype and so there was a bit more distribution,
and it still remained kind of neutral. But, but the second top of 69 K was just, you know, based on long term holder conviction, rather than short term holder and hype, and you can clearly see that in this chart that there is accumulation accumulation
going on, while making a new autumn high which is, you know, it's quite interesting, you know, it shows that there is conviction from long term holders, and I think that's a very bullish sign, you know, because that's once short term holders start to come in this
kind of hype starts to pick up again and that's just a matter of time. It takes probably a catalyst, you know some type of catalyst to start going, you know, maybe, maybe the, the meetup in Miami can can, you know, cause some momentum, you know, to start going
relatively soon, or some other bullish news, you know, but but we kind of see that that short term holders are slowly getting, you know, they're picking up we've just made a low, and we're kind of picking up.
So short term holders are slowly coming back into the market. And so it takes some time but in the meantime, long term holders are half conviction, and that's why we made the second top, you know, in just basically more bear market conditions without any hype,
which is, which is quite remarkable.
So bullish, I absolutely love that point route you've made it before on Twitter spaces here and I'm really excited to just continue to see the long term holder conviction grow and that be something that people rally around.
I also am kind of bullish for the Bitcoin 22 pump so I mean I don't want to jinx it too early but a lot of people are coming together for Bitcoin 22 it's going to be a big deal, and it's really really exciting.
So, check that out go to be dot tc forward slash conference, April 6 is 49 days away is April 6 through ninth. All your favorite Bitcoiners today we just announced Jordan Peterson, a lot of really big names.
President Bukele has promised huge announcements so really really excited for this event.
But yeah, I mean, it really exciting to see that and I want to make a shout out for everyone on YouTube, smash that like button, make sure to subscribe to Bitcoin magazine.
We're bringing you know BS Bitcoin content, every single day, and multi channels we're doing it on spaces we're doing it on YouTube we're doing it everywhere so bring you the charts bring you the newsletters, bring you the hard hitting Bitcoin
content so you know this is what Bitcoin magazine is all about and we're doing it on pretty much every platform.
Back to you Sam.
Well, I've got one more here in just terms of on chain indicators kind of macro cyclical where we are, however, you know, and then, and then we can go to another topic we can dive into any other kind of macro on chain any kind of on chain indicators
want to cover.
This one is a little bit more complex but it's got a lot of information tied into it's called reserve risk.
So basically what this is is a cyclical market indicator and it's trying to quantify the risk reward or kind of the opportunity risk of allocating to Bitcoin based on conviction a long term holder so we talked about how you can see the conviction of long
term holders in, you can look at their supply, you can look at the profit taking you can look at coin days destroyed which skews towards older coins.
So it's kind of a metric that encompasses a lot of that all together.
And so, I won't get into maybe the weeds of this calculations because it's really deep and not fun necessarily for Twitter spaces but we got an issue on it on the deep dive.
It's number 94 we can put a link in for that, you know glass node has some great videos and talking through how reserve versus calculate if you're interested in getting to the weeds but you know really what this is saying is like one reserve risk is low.
Holder conviction is high, and prices low. And so when it's, and then reserve risk is high, you know holder conviction is is more low and prices high and so when you think about the best time that you want to allocate to Bitcoin on a risk reward standpoint
based on its history, you know the best time to buy Bitcoin or allocate to Bitcoin is when you have confidence from, you know, long term holder owners of the asset and that's very high.
But then the price is very low and the worst time to buy is when you know their confidence is low and so you know this is a good you know indicator when people talk about the smart money, long term holders, what's happening, and we're getting to a period now.
Where price falling holder conviction, you know, is increasing some and you're getting to kind of this opportunity state or kind of better reward state to allocate based on history so it's been very few time to receive reserve risk really go through like a very low percent
kind of max opportunity allocation, like we talked about before, didn't really get kind of a blow off top, which comes with a blow off top in this metric so may not be as much downside so more confluence in just allocating and talking about long term holder conviction.
Yeah, exactly. So I think this this chart again shows what we kind of just summarized you know like. So, again, like no no dark red colors and there's even like only slight bit of orange here and so so why would we get into this darker green.
I cannot see it happen. But, you know, again, if I look at some of the bottom bottom indicators that I like private ones that I use, you know floor indicator, which is currently at 29 which would be kind of Max pain.
I still think that we, we, we, we would maybe barely touch like this, this this darker green zone, let's say so. But, but I think yeah, to me it looks still again like the macro bottom is in.
You know, anything can happen if we get a lot of uncertainty, but it also has to feel uncertain right like in this, you know, conditions have to feel realistic I mean we see a bit of bear market conditions on chain.
So obviously the sentiment has to align with that. So I understand that there's a lot of fear and uncertainty in the market. And, you know, but but once Bitcoin starts going you know about 50k or so, again, I'm sure like the bullishness will come back and people will
start saying again like oh yeah it was inevitable you know like, but, but now it has to feel realistic, it has to feel that that there is all this uncertainty. And, yeah, we can see some some deleveraging and some some less risk taking and the derivatives
as well. Basically until March, it seems that that people are, you know, not not taking on as much risks and derivatives as well. And so it probably has to do with the with the rate hike that that's coming up.
And so, yeah, it makes sense that that until that until then there's some uncertainty, and we will get this, this choppy price action in this range. So, so that's kind of my opinion on all of this.
I want to jump in real quick. Someone that I respect an enormous amount, who is a macro thinker and really big picture person hedge fund guy says, I think we're going to go down to 20k.
How do you all feel about that statement, given the the macro circumstances around stock market around macro uncertainty geopolitical uncertainty, etc.
Yeah, I mean, from an on chain perspective, I do not see it happen. As I said, like, so my floor is at 29k and that would be kind of the lowest we go. But but but sure I mean if we get like a serious black swan if we get like the S&P to drop 40% or something.
Yeah, sure, Bitcoin could maybe have lower, you know, with the, it would still be a wick, in my opinion, you know, relatively, but, but yeah, I think, based on historic data, it seems very, very unlikely, you know, realized price is a bit lower than than my floor indicator,
we could we could see, you know, a wick down to the realized price or even a bit below we have seen that in severe in bear mark in severe bear markets, you know, like, so, in the 2018, we went below realized price for a bit as well.
But again, I would say since we didn't have the upside, I don't just I just don't see us go there to that that extreme of a downside.
Yeah, I think it's a really good point say, you know, without the upside, where's the downside, I think, ultimately what you're betting on there is, like Ruth said black swan event something in equities you know equities already down 10 15% already had that drawdown so essentially
with Bitcoin being a higher beta asset to equities kind of moves further on their moves.
They're really going to be looking for another 10 15% type move down event. So I think that's what you're really banking on if you're looking at price going that far down.
Even then, no realized cost basis right now is that 24,000 and there's been a few events and bitcoins time where that's been tested where price goes below that in the worst case scenario.
And then that's quickly, you know, long term great buying opportunity if you're looking at you know four or five year time horizon so I would put a low probability for mine, not out of question, but I think, you know, there's some bearish room to go lower but not that low.
All right, where do we want to take it next.
Exchange balances.
Yeah, we can cover exchange real quick I want to leave I know we've done has done a lot of interesting work on having cycles super cycle analysis and we've got some chart, a chart from him in here so love to spend more time on that we can run through just kind
of the state of exchange balances so far.
Get this back to changing slides.
Quick reminder if you are listening to this on spaces we have a lot of new people, we are sharing all of these charts over on YouTube so the very first twin pinned tweet has the YouTube link and you can watch this live.
But yeah, I think we are sharing the charts again. Go for it Sam.
Back up. You know I think exchange balances, you know, it's a simple way to look at the market but a good way for a lot of people are thinking on chain all the time to try and get a more macro picture of what's happening as I think you know exchange kind of balances
and the flows can give you a proxy for some demand especially for outflows and when that's happening.
We're just caution with the exchange balance flows, you know, shorter time friends you're looking at day or few days. This stuff changes all the time and it's very dependent upon address and entity clustering and classifications and really sophisticated
data science techniques that we don't do in house on a lot of classrooms in this case with this data. So just caution people when you're looking at that on short timeframe but I love this chart from a monthly view.
There's a lot in terms of, you know, this, this trend in exchange balances declining since 2020 which is really March 2020 code crash.
You have years and years of, you know, inflows on monthly and annual levels and then come 2020 and we see this huge inflow outflux outflow Bitcoin from exchanges each month.
You know continue to see so far in 2022, kind of into January. You know we had some modest outflow into October, which we talked about maybe some more macro selling in October November December kind of in Q4.
It was, you know, much smaller in comparison to what we saw in May of 2021 right before that kind of huge liquidations cascade.
And so we are starting to see a decent amount relatively strong amount of exchange flowing out of Bitcoin flowing out of exchanges which you know good signal of like a short term demand so I would look at that and look at funding flows and look at kind
of accumulation across different groups and say that's good confluence that there you know there's good demand and buying here for Bitcoin.
So hopefully we're going to continue this, this trend through the next couple months.
Yeah, I think it's a very good sign exchange outflows, you know that just means there's a bit more conviction people are storing their their coins and cold storage.
You know, I also think we will kind of just, since we are in this kind of accumulation phase. It's likely that we will continue to see exchange outflows.
And, you know, I think only when there's a bit of hype coming.
And some, you know, if we if we get really some higher prices that people are tempted to sell again, you know that that we will see some inflows into exchanges, so I still expect in the next months to to just kind of have like this
slight outflow of coins out of exchanges.
So,
and then there's just another way to look at it show another chart here just looking at like the latest 30 days some kind of cumulative flows of exchanges.
And when that's, you know, on the scale here we've got an extreme of you know 200,000 really dark blue flowing out of exchanges first, you know 200,000 flowing in in a state of our last 30 days about you know 35,000 Bitcoin flowing out of exchanges,
somewhat of a decelerating trend kind of shifts right at that January 22nd where Bitcoin seems to find that bottom around 35,000 start to see a lot more buying and exchange outflowing around the same time.
So just an interesting thing to keep track on.
And then, you know, last year we can do here on exchanges and we can, you know, maybe switch over and talk about having cycles.
This is just another way to look at that relationship between price, I find it useful for myself I think about the 90 day flow of exchanges, you know, net positive, or like inflow versus outflow.
And so I've got the axis flipped here on the right hand side which is kind of that total 90 day cumulative flow, so that when you know Bitcoin is flowing out, you're expecting to see this you know correlation with price moving up.
You're expecting to see exchanges kind of see that price off and so that's a relationship we've seen pretty strong over the last year apart from a few months. And so that's what we're seeing now right we're seeing what seems to be more demand flowing in more
and out of exchanges price kind of moving in coordination with that so you know interesting way to look at like the 90 day trends and see how that's going to continue but so far you know kind of a deceleration in terms of more outflow is a good sign short term.
Yeah, definitely fully fully agree on this chart.
Well, why don't we switch topics here then and then talk about, you know, some Bitcoin super cycle dynamics. Maybe your thoughts or thesis on this route I know you just put this out today so I'm curious to hear I haven't got to hear kind of a more long thesis
or understanding of it yet.
Yeah, so here we look at a bit of the supply dynamics, you know, on chain, and that in terms of cycles.
So, so you can see here. It starts around the second having, you know, we have this supply from long term holders that is in profit, which turns over right and this is normal during, you know, the beginning of like a new bull market when hype, when there's
demand, you know, this was the 2017 cycle, there's a lot of demand coming in, in the cycle. So, you know, profit from our supply from long term holders goes to short term holders.
And so you got this turnover. And then, so obviously at the top, we have the short term holder, short term holder top in 2017 a lot of hype in the market that hype ends.
And so so then, you know, you can see also that kind of we mark a bottom with with the profit, you know supply is supplied by long term holders that is in profit.
And, and then we kind of, you know, we got this, we get into this bear market. And so basically you could see this this first dotted line, basically as a kind of a first support line as well.
There from, if you look at supply from from long term holders. And then so so if we get into further in the bear market we break that support basically and we go down even further during the bear.
And this again so we had a blow off up in 2017, we went to these extreme lows, you know, in, in 2018 19 even. And, and then we got this long term holder run in 2019 which was actually just based on the conviction again of long term holders
because there was like hardly any demand coming in into Bitcoin and there was no hype.
There was a bit of hype around the long term holders but there was not not there were not many short term holders coming into the market like some in 2019 but but it was still relatively low.
And so we got this this this top based on long term holder conviction there. We went to 14 K and then we started, you know, dropping again it was not sustainable because there was no demand new demand coming in to keep on, you know, keep this move going and so
so we so we went down, and you can see them that we kind of made the bottom again with the profit with the long term holder supply and profit in that first orange circle which you could mark basically as well the end of, of that of that cycle, or the start of
basically a new cycle.
And, and so we find that support on that same, you know dotted line the first support area, and then we get soon after we actually started recovering, but we soon after get this this the COVID you know the black black swan covered event, and we drop,
and therefore we drop even lower so we get kind of this black swan we, we go to the to the floor basically in this chart. And, and then we obviously that is Bitcoin is very underpriced, you know, many of the long term holders started to buy when Bitcoin
started to drop there, me included, and we went, we went straight back up, you know, and this was the third halving also some of the hype maybe from the from the having coming up, you know, fear quickly dissolved and we got back into this, this bull market
mode and and so we made a similar pattern there with new highs you know we had again this kind of, you know, soon after a third having we made like a small top, a bit of a dip there and then again we went into this new phase of hype, and the same thing happens
over and happens over you know long term holder supply of profit, long term holders that profit moves to short term holders, we get this short term holder top, you know, exactly the same thing has happened during the during the, the second having cycle basically
and and and the last run, it was purely based on long term holders, short term holders were out of the market, and we made this, this top, just based on conviction of long term holders. And yeah, since then we have come down a bit, but we found now, again this support at
this first area now there is no second floor here. That's again for me a reasoning that that why I don't see also Bitcoin price going even lower, because we kind of found support at this level that, you know, seem to be also, you know, a line, if you look at this
pattern in the previous cycle. And so I would argue that from here up, like, we again we are starting a new hype cycle basically, you know, it will go slow with the beginning, you know, hype will take several months before new hype comes in.
But, but to me this is kind of, you know, the first sign on chain that we're kind of deviating from a traditional cycle, which used to be from having to having, because here we have seen this exact same pattern that we had in the whole last having it just played
out and we're not even halfway this having right so so to me it seems that we're kind of deviating away from the having hype cycle, and that that that that you know perhaps like we could see this as a that a new cycle starting, which is basically the meaning
of the super cycle right deviating away from from the traditional having cycle. And, and so for me these are the first signs of that. And, you know, together with like a, you know, more derivatives in the market and things going on.
I think this kind of makes sense to me as well, you know, at some point we had to deviate away from it because also the having the influence of the having is kind of has been decreasing traditionally you know every having impact was kind of less, except,
you know, mostly was a lot of hype around the having and that certainly could be again about next having. So, it could still be a catalyst, you know, but, but it seems to me like I cannot imagine now the next two years basically until next having that we're just going to have
new conditions, you know, I would expect, again, for this demand to slowly pick up. And, you know, the basically the start of a new cycle, as you can see in this chart, you know, like, so so I still expect to make some new all time highs, maybe later this year,
and then perhaps be at the end of this year and certainly in 2023, you know, I wouldn't rule that out that can, it can take a year for this to build up. But, but it kind of seems to me that we're at a low, and that we're, you know, slowly picking up again,
the start of a new cycle which should to me is very bullish.
Sam I want to pass it to you man.
No, I love this idea, you know, I've been trying around my head around for a long time, you know, only a few data points in terms of where the cycles have been, and obviously you know q1 was a big way to see during this macro uncertainty that that kind of cycle that
was happening before and when you look at cycle multiples, that that's, you know, getting more diminished in time whether it's lengthening or whether we're going through a lot more of these kind of mini cycles where we get this less volatility on the upside,
lower volatility on the downside so seems to be the first of its kind is playing out and kind of expect to see a lot more of those can maybe smaller style cycles in here play out as the asset gets, you know, more institutionalized more capitals flowing in
and it's just muted anyway. But then again at the end of it, you know, there's this s curve adoption that we're just taking part in the very beginning stages of if you thinking that you know Bitcoin is two to 3% of the adoption of the population so in my framework
there's an s curve adoption, that kind of exponential s curve trend that we've seen with internet and smartphones, and, and kind of watching that speed up and assuming that Bitcoin has to go through that type of phase two, which, you know, whether it's
this time around in two years where we see that type of explosive exponential move or kind of maybe two years or four years from now.
So, you know, it's hard to tell when and when, when and where we're in that adoption curve and how fast it's going to move. But no, I love this chart from root.
Yeah, thank you. So it also, I mean, it depends you know the on the definition of cycle a lot you know people use the cycle all the time.
Yeah, but you know you can measure from different points you can measure from having to having. Now I'm kind of looking at like supply a supply dynamic cycle basically within Bitcoin, you know, so, so there's different definitions for cycle which
make it very confusing.
So, still from having to having, you could look at this from, you know, from a lengthening cycle perspective right like we could get a top next year or something, or new autumn high next year let's say, then it would be perfectly a lengthening cycle,
if you look if your definition is cycle from having to having right so so it very much depends on this but but underneath all this there these dynamics are going on and we can see them on chain, and I think they're very interesting to look at and so it's
it's a bit of a different definition of cycle that we use here. But, but, but yeah I think the supply dynamics are very interesting to see play out. And, and so, so yeah I'm very bullish for the next few years to be honest.
Yeah, we've been going for about an hour here. I think it's getting about time that we wrap it up, want to go into kind of last words I don't know if there's anything else that you want to share Sam or, or if we can just kind of go to close closing thoughts
here.
Let's go close the thoughts sounds good.
Yeah, I mean if you were to summarize what you're seeing what you're talking about in the deep dive maybe what you're dropping later today.
You know what would you tell the Bitcoin is listening.
Yeah, definitely so my point of view, you know I'm more leaning, you know, macro concerned uncertain bearish however you want to call it slightly kind of gray area over the short term next few months.
There's, you know, some incredible fundamentals within Bitcoin from when you look at the on chain perspective and you look at kind of this lower dampening of derivatives right now.
So very bullish from that perspective kind of more long term still cautious in the short term over the next three months would love to see how Bitcoin responds to to equities over the next few months and then also look at kind of this divergence
that's something that everyone's always talking about and hoping that we see more of that as a standalone asset over the next year.
What we're dropping today is probably some extension of these charts looking at just cycle top bottom indicators for on chain, which lean a little bit neutral to to bullish right now from you know over looking at 20 different ones so probably talk about through
some of those.

Yeah, so, yeah, I think I kind of summarized, or several times I got back to kind of similar conclusions over several charts that we looked at. So I think my perspective is kind of clear in general, you know we this macro bottom is likely in.
There's some choppy price behavior in between 47 K and 36 K in my opinion, those are the most likely things that you know we can obviously go lower with uncertainty with macro conditions, but, you know, I still Bitcoin is actually the risk of asset.
We still don't understand, which is why, you know, it's seen seen still as a risk on acid with, but I also think that at some point we will deviate from that, you know, it might still take some time.
I'm actually very bullish on Bitcoin. In the next years, you know, I think 100 K is really nothing. I'm, but I look more at macro, you know, I'm not a day trader, I like to look at macro trends within Bitcoin, more than, than just on the short term so so if I say like it likely
in the does not mean that, you know, we can, we cannot drop a few thousand from here, you know, I think that's totally normal, you know, but any price level in these ranges you know 36, you know, and between current price.
And, you know, if you think two years into the future and you know I would expect very likely to be above 100 K, then that then this is, these are perfect entry points you know like we've seen in some of the charts today that you know many on chain indicators
signal that that a bottom that we've been in kind of a macro bottom that we're stealing quite, you know, an opportunity for buying. And so I think that's that is very bullish and, and yeah I hope to come next week or so with some, some more.
Some exciting news model I've been working on for some time also a macro trend within Bitcoin. And so sure check out my, my, my profile my Twitter profile.

Awesome, awesome. Well, Sam route. This was a great show really appreciate y'all walking us through what is happening with bitcoins price being pretty honest and somber about the uncertainty that's ahead of us.
There's only one thing that's certain for me and that is that the Bitcoin 22 conference is going to be absolutely sick. We're going to be throwing a motherfucking music festival at the end, we're going to be hosting people like Jordan Peterson president president
Bukele, Michael sailor, and many many more incredible people so go check out the Bitcoin conference b.tc forward slash conference, and go get your ticket, and I think we have a promo code, y t mag.
And that saves you 10% off and if you pay in Bitcoin, you save even more so stack the code with paying in Bitcoin, and maximize your savings you're not going to want to miss the Bitcoin conference in Miami is going to be absolutely incredible.

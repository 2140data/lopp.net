Hello and welcome to an all new episode of the Bitcoin new show right here on the CryptoCast
network.
Thank you ladies and gentlemen again so much for joining us on this beautiful Sunday or
whenever you're joining us.
So if you missed the live show, make sure to join us in the comments below.
We are screen sharing our website, the CryptoCast.network website, where you can find our YouTube, Twitter,
Instagram, iTunes, and RSS feeds.
We also have some merch if you guys want to check that out.
And then if you really want to support this channel and content like this, we definitely
ask that you take a look at our donation address there on the website at CryptoCast.network
as this is a community supported YouTube channel.
So we very much thank you guys for all your donations and all your feedback.
We just try to bring out the Bitcoin truth to you guys as much as we can.
So with that aside, let's stop the screen sharing and get into the quick bit section
before we go ahead and get to our main three topics, guys.
Let's see if we can find the notes.
It's around here somewhere.
There we go.
Okay, here we go.
So quick big section, guys, the crypto exchanges out there, be careful everybody as usual,
but the crypto exchanges out there are still complete amateur hour, guys.
We have some people on Kraken that flash crash that thing down to $100 if you guys didn't
catch that.
So make sure you guys are very, very careful if you are day trading on these crypto exchanges.
They are simply not up to snuff yet, but I expect this to change going over the next
few years, three to five years specifically, people are going to start complaining about
this more and more.
So then we got Samurai Wallet releases their public open source code of their dojo software.
So this is really cool.
Up until now, of course, you've had to, I need to trust the Samurai servers with your
public keys, but now you can run your own server instead.
So make sure you guys check that out.
Samurai Wallet still doing awesome privacy stuff, awesome privacy work for Bitcoin.
Make sure you guys check them out.
Then BCH, everybody loves them.
They have the BCH chain suffered a 51% reorg just recently where some transactions were
reversed due to some miners colluding with each other to reverse a transaction.
Make sure you guys check that out.
BitMEX did a pretty good write up on that as they usually do.
The BitMEX research team over there guys, make sure you check that blog out, blog.bitmex.com.
And then we got the Human Rights Foundation that have published a guide for activists
and journalists to use Bitcoin privately.
So this is really, really cool.
This is important guys, because Bitcoin is not very simple to use and to use it privately,
it's even more difficult.
So articles like this really, really help the people that need it the most, that need
the privacy on the Bitcoin blockchain the most.
So check that article out by the Human Rights Foundation.
And then HODL, HODL, the non-custodial exchange over there in Latvia, they have enabled mainnet
trading via Lightning Network.
And I expect this trend to continue more and more exchanges enabling Lightning Network
activity wallets or Lightning Network wallets so that you can at the very least be able
to exit out of the exchange via Lightning.
So that maybe if you don't want to do trading with the trades in and out with Lightning,
you might at least be able to withdraw your funds over the Lightning Network.
So that's going to be really cool.
I expect that trend again to continue more and more exchanges supporting Lightning Network.
Then we have the Bitcoin symbol has been introduced into Apple and Microsoft platforms.
So this is a sign of the times, guys, Bitcoin becoming more and more mainstream.
We have now officially have the symbol in our desktop application software, our office
software.
So make sure to check that out.
It's pretty funny.
Then we got LND watchtowers, guys.
They're almost here.
I believe a pull request was recently created.
So this is getting us really, really closer.
Watchtowers are going to be very important for those wallets that are non-custodial.
So if you guys are not, if you guys don't have a custodial wallet and you're taking
care of your own, running your own Lightning Network node and taking care of your own transactions
there, this is going to be really important to have.
So make sure you guys check that out.
Again, article from Bitcoin magazine.
Those guys continue to kill it.
Shout out to Bitcoin magazine.
And then Ledger integrates native Segwit BEC32 support.
This is really cool.
BEC32 has a number of features over the standard transaction.
So guys, make sure you check that out.
More and more people are supporting that as well.
And finally, Tippin, the Lightning Network Tippin bot over there for social networks
like Twitter has released a version 1.0.
So those guys continue to keep killing it over there, keep supporting new features.
So if you guys want to really test out the Lightning Network, tippin.me wallet is a great
way to do that.
They are, I believe, custodial right now.
But I think they are having options to run it non-custodial as well coming soon.
So with that aside, guys, let's go ahead and introduce our amazing panelists.
We're going to have a tech show today, guys, when we're talking about some of the latest
tech in Bitcoin.
So I'm really excited about this.
Of course, it's near and dear to my heart.
So let's introduce some of these guests.
We have Mr. Patrick Miller, our returning guest here, guys.
He's a Bitcoin enthusiast and pundit.
Patrick, how are you doing?
I'm doing great.
Good to be here.
Thanks so much for having me again.
You bet, man.
Thanks to have you on again.
We've had Patrick on a number of episodes.
Make sure you guys check that out.
And then we got returning again, Mr. Gabriel Devine, again, Bitcoin enthusiast, entrepreneur
and to date has never been served a gag order.
Gabriel Devine, how are you, man?
I can't actually tell you right now.
And I've taken off the warrant canary from my website after a visit from some men in
black.
No, I actually have not.
I have not.
I can speak totally freely.
I have been approached to promote scams a few times on Twitter.
I was always very entertaining to to read their pitches in my direct messages.
So please keep sending them.
They are hilarious.
Come on, Gabriel.
They're the best, best, best profitable ICO for you.
All right.
And finally, guys, introducing the special guest today, joining us on the last minute.
So we really, really extra appreciate it, Mr. Jameson Lopp.
You guys all know him, Cypher Punk and CTO of Casa Hodel.
Jameson, how you doing?
Not bad.
Glad I could join you today.
Yeah, man.
I really appreciate that last minute request.
Of course, Elena was supposed to be on, but she couldn't make it due to some scheduling
conflicts.
So we're more than happy to have you as well, Jameson.
So thanks so much, man.
Let's go ahead and get right to it, guys.
We've got our three main topics.
It's going to get a little technical, but we do want to try to explain the main points
of these technologies to try to get across the pluses and minuses.
So let's go with you, Jameson, first.
The first topic we have here, guys, is the Bitcoin developers propose stronger, faster
blockchain network via Erlay.
So this is a new protocol, spelled E-R-L-A-Y, created by Gregory Maxwell and Peter Woolley.
It alters the way these transactions are relayed so that they use significantly less bandwidth.
Jameson, let me ask you, could this be considered maybe a bit of a game changer for the Bitcoin
network?
Because we are talking possibly about bandwidth speeds, increases of 75%.
What is your take on this?
Yeah.
So I mean, that's one of the most, I think, prevalent improvements that we've seen in
the Bitcoin protocol over the past few years is efficiency improvements, performance improvements,
trying to continue to decrease the cost of running a fully validating node.
And I can tell you personally, from the nodes that I run, you can even go look at the stats
on statoshi.info.
Bandwidth is by far one of the biggest bottlenecks, especially if you're running a node that is
highly connected.
So my node, for example, maxes out all 125 peers or so.
And if you actually drill down on the bandwidth page, you can specifically see what the different
protocol messages are that are using the different amounts of bandwidth.
And surprisingly, one of the highest uses of bandwidth is the INV message.
And if you're not familiar with the low-level protocol, INV basically means invitation.
And it basically means you are asking another node or another node is asking you, hey, do
you have this piece of data?
Do you have this transaction?
Do you have this block?
So this is not actually being used to transmit the blocks and the transactions, but rather
as a part of almost like a SYN act type of back and forth handshake of saying, hey, do
you want this information in the first place?
And just due to the way that the data propagates on the network right now, it is incredibly
redundant.
And I'm probably just pulling this out of thin air.
But if, for example, you're connected to 100 peers, I bet that you receive INV messages
more than 50 times for every transaction and block that comes through, because many, many
of your different peers are going to be sending you these messages.
And then you're going to be sending to the other peers, basically, as the transaction
or the block floods out through the entire network.
There's really no sophisticated logic to it, it's a spray and pray to everybody, which
means it's very massively redundant and robust.
You're very likely to get your message out to the entire network very quickly, but you're
also going to be sending a lot of redundant back and forth to your peers.
So this improvement is basically changing it so that you're only going to be directly
talking to a subset of your peers.
And then there's going to be a reconciliation phase later, just to make sure that you didn't
miss anybody.
That's really cool.
I like the reconciliation phase later.
So just to quickly recap, guys, make sure you do check out statoshi.info.
This is Jameson's site, where he posts a lot of stats about the Bitcoin blockchain, including
some of this data here that he's saying.
And the spray and pray, I like that description more than the flood network.
Spray and pray, essentially, that's what these nodes do, which has downsides and upsides,
of course, but one of the downsides is the redundancy.
So essentially, the main idea, then, is instead of announcing every transaction to every peer,
announcements are only sent directly over a small number of connections.
So that's going to be interesting.
And apparently, they say that if outbound peer count was increased to 32, Erle would
save around 75% of the bandwidth.
So that is really interesting because, guys, one of the most important things we can do
for the Bitcoin protocol is to make sure that everybody can still run a full node.
So that is very, very important to be able to validate your own transactions.
That is one of the main use cases and value propositions of the Bitcoin blockchain.
So Gabriel, let's go to you.
What are your thoughts on Jameson's comments and this new protocol, this called Erle, the
ability to have faster block propagation?
How important do you think this is to the Bitcoin network in the future?
And how likely do you think this is of getting software in?
I just love this type of low-level research and development and, of course, innovation
and high, massive increases in efficiency and without too bad of trade-offs just because
it's a better invention, you know, replacing little chunks of the code that were there
as like, well, we can, you know, gossip protocol, just slap it together.
It'll work.
We've only got six users, you know, it's 2009, 10, whatever, you know, it's just like popping
it together and just make a couple of, you know, improvements, small improvements over
time.
And then, you know, in 2011, I'm sure people were like, okay, this is, there's quite a
few of these INV messages, you know, probably I'm sure people were already noticing back
then and someday this is going to be an issue and maybe we should try to come up with something
better.
And that's probably what Max, you know, Greg Maxwell and Peter Willey were doing when they
came up with mini-sketch, which is a like hardcore mathematical invention that they,
you know, made public I believe was about two years ago.
And that's for the set reconciliation because you need to, you know, instead of sending
messages to everybody and just flooding and going, hey, let's hope it works, you know,
you're talking about dividing it up into chunks and that always introduces risks unless you're
really careful with the mathematics and check everything to make sure that it's provably
not, you know, scammable and all that.
And so they had to invent mini-sketch first before they were even able to put together
this transaction relay protocol, ERLAY, which I guess is maybe kind of named after Efficient
Relay.
I'm not sure the other names of innovations that we're going to be talking about today,
I have my notes here in my special book, have much more clever names, ERLAY is a little
bit clunky.
But you know what?
It's short, which is great.
So it works.
And yeah, I'm not here to critique the, you know, the aesthetics here.
The point is that this thing exists.
It's not just Greg Maxwell and Peter Willey.
It's also Gleb Nelmenko and his advisors at UBC, which are Aleksandr Fedorova and Ivan
Beshasnich.
So these five amazing, you know, people put together this incredible set reconciliation
thing.
It's really, you know, pretty intense, you know, it's a little above my head.
But I know that, you know, that's, it's, it's, this is how these protocols work.
It's totally incredible.
Actually, all of the subject matter that you picked today is, is like totally mind blowing
vortex.
I knew that this stuff was coming out because I've been reading this stuff, but like these
three things are totally amazing.
And ERLAY is just such a great example of the type of really essential building block,
low level work that guys like Willie and Maxwell have been doing for several years now that
are just things that the users will just, you just won't see it and everything will
just work a little bit better and a little bit more efficiency.
And it's like this stuff that, I mean, we're obviously working on UX stuff too, and you
know, lightning and stuff that's really like more, you know, on the, on the, you know,
user end where you can kind of notice it more as a lay person.
But this is the stuff that we really need to take care of now because, you know, after
two years ago when transaction malleability, the largest bug in Bitcoin was fixed.
Now we have all these efficiency issues that aren't bugs.
They're just inefficiencies that, you know, the core developers are rightfully very focused
on because it's conceivable that as time goes on, the protocol, the Bitcoin protocol itself
will begin to what you call a gel or congeal a bit and become more resistant to changes
that are at the low level, whereas now people are real open to it.
And especially when you have a situation where, you know, mini sketch is an efficient library
for set reconciliation, it's a mathematically provable situation.
Now, of course, sometimes people overlook things and you, and there's vulnerabilities
that you didn't foresee, but in general, if you can, you know, mathematically prove things,
and that's a theme through actually all three of these subject that you chose today that
is totally amazing.
So really fantastic situation where basically the efficiency is increased by 75% with hardly
any with no trade off just because it's a superior design.
I would mention there is one small trade off.
This is not a 100% perfect solution.
And the trade off is I think they estimated it would take one to two seconds longer for
a transaction to propagate across the entire network.
So the trade off is a very, very slightly slower propagation across the network for
a very huge efficiency gain in the total amount of bandwidth used across the network.
Do you have off the top of your head, I know you, you know, with Satoshi, you deal with
the stats a lot.
Do you have any idea what the average transaction propagation time is lately?
Yeah, actually, if you look on bitnodes.earn.com, they have a stats page with block and transactionally.
And I think that it's only in the realm of two or three seconds.
Okay, so that's actually pretty big percentage wise, that's actually a pretty nasty knock.
That's like a 20, 30, 50, even up to 50% slam on the trend on the propagation time.
So that's that's moderately large.
Well, so they had several graphs in the actual paper that was released. And of course, they
had simulated various sizes of networks. So there were a few assumptions at play. But
I don't think that it'll slow down the propagation by more than a few seconds, which, you know,
we're mainly discussing, you know, what is really going to impact the user here. And
I think that from an end user impact, they'll see a lot more positive impact by the bandwidth
reduction than they will from having to wait a couple seconds on a transaction propagating.
Yeah, that's clear to me too.
Yeah, it's all about trade offs, guys. You know, this is what the Bitcoin core developers
and developers working on Bitcoin are just just live to do they just live to create more
efficiency and find more efficiency. And when we find even just five to 10% gains, just
everybody kind of on the on the mailing list pretty much jumps up and down. But you know,
when you can find 75% gain guides, that's pretty, pretty impressive, especially when
we're this far into the protocol development. Patrick, let's get your comments in here before
we end this topic. Go ahead.
If I may, I just want to quickly wrap up what I was going to say, you guys out there just
to give you an idea where this is at. The white paper is out. And it's there, you know,
soliciting feedback on it. And once people begin to, you know, gather toward consensus
on early, they will be creating a bit, because I'm assuming that they're actually Jameson,
if you could comment on what's required, what what would be required, the type of thing
that will be required in the bit because because this is something that requires changes, obviously,
to the Bitcoin core protocol, change, change, it's just a, you know, a data and networking
relay change. So I imagine it's not going to be that difficult. I don't, you know, it
would be speculative to say, like, how are we going to implement, you know, like a handshake,
I guess, of like, how do we know which peers we can do this set reconciliation with? Does
it have to be a bidirectional thing? I'm not entirely sure what level of like compatibility
it will have with with nodes that aren't performing that. But it's definitely not a consensus
change. So I think that it should be fairly, fairly simple to to spec out and get consensus
on implementing. Very interesting, indeed. All right, Patrick, let's get your comments
in here before we end this topic. Go ahead. Yeah, I read the paper as soon as it came
out as really exciting. The propagation time trade offs that were made there, they did
mention in the paper that that can be adjusted. So if they if there was, you know, they decided
to maybe maybe reduce those propagation times a little bit more, they could there could
make a trade off for a little bit a little bit more bandwidth usage for a little, little
faster propagation times. But in the paper, they mentioned they specifically chose that,
because they seem that was like the right trade off. I don't have much more to add for
these guys. I just think this is the this is the important work that needs to be done
in order for the Bitcoin network to really scale. So even you know, if you know, as you
know, as, let's say blocks continue to grow in size, and you know, there's more bandwidth
pressures on node, there's more transactions, this is the exact type of innovation we would
want in place if there was ever going to be further growth in the block size and more
trends on more on chain transactions and also, which I'm not sure if that's going to happen.
But also this, you know, this just reducing this bandwidth is really important for allowing
full nodes to operate on really small devices. And that's, and that's the key point here
is that this is kind of a game changer for, you know, very, like mobile devices are very
low power low, you know, you know, IoT type devices and stuff like that will benefit strongly
from from this.
Yep, great points. Great points, Patrick. I mean, again, I mean, what everybody has
said here is that this is the low level guys, iterative work that really results in orders
of magnitude efficiency over time. This is just just the really important work, the stuff
that's not sexy that we can't just place on a, you know, the big conference or anything
like that. But just one final point I wanted to add is that remember all this guys is happening
simultaneously, right? So we have amazing improvements like this, you know, to block
propagation bandwidth, and we have, you know, people working on the financialization of
Bitcoin. And then we have, you know, people working on UX, right? Some of the improving
wallets and things like that. So there's just all of this stuff guys is happening because
Bitcoin is actually a truly decentralized, the only decentralized blockchain at scale
in production, in my opinion. So it's very exciting to see all the stuff happening. And
again, guys, you know, Bitcoin is scaling, we have faster block propagation than ever.
We have blocks consistently over one megabyte, and we have more and more work being done
on the lightning network. So very, very cool stuff, guys. Let's go ahead and move on to
the next topic here. Before we do that, we would ask that you could just please if you
guys are new to the channel, hit that subscribe button. And otherwise, hit the thumbs up really
helps us get into more people's feeds. And if you are listening on the audio, we really
would appreciate a review on the iTunes is again, that helps more people find the show.
So thanks again, guys, for joining us. Let's go ahead and move on to the second topic here.
Hyperloop, more technology coming out of LND. Over there, the technology or the company
being run by Elizabeth Stark is that is actually invested in by the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.
So it's pretty one of my favorite companies because of that. So interesting stuff, guys.
Hyperloop, a new concept by lightning or by by LND labs aiming to solve liquidity problems.
So this is pretty cool because they did release some of this technology earlier called loop
in. They released it about a couple of months ago. And of course, we covered it here on
the channel. You know, this this service allows users to fill or empty lightning channels
without closing them, thus reducing on chain fees. So it really helps, you know, manage
your liquidity. And so I'll Jameson again, let's go with you first here on this. Well,
this Hyperloop concept, you know, it does rely on something like signature aggregation.
And so maybe it would work even better with Schnorr and that type of things. But what
is your what is your thoughts on this technology? And again, like how difficult is this going
to really to be used on the network? Any soft forks or any crazy things like that we need
that that we need to to get this working? I mean, from a technical standpoint, it's
it's already usable. I mean, it's it's basically it's using a technology called atomic swaps.
And more specifically, it's using something called submarine swaps, which Alex Bosworth
and Rosebeef both kind of came up with independently. And this is really just another method for
using the quote unquote hash time lock contracts, which is one of the fundamental features that
is used for lightning network channels. But instead of just creating a lightning network
channel, instead you are you have two different people who are interacting with a middleman.
Now this middleman is not a trusted custodian, but rather the middleman is kind of the one
who is helping bridge the liquidity gap. And so you've got one person who has on chain
funds and wants off chain funds. You've got another person who has the opposite. They
have off chain funds in the lightning channel, but they want on chain funds. And the middleman
is basically the one bridging the gap where that swap, right? That's why this swap. This
is the swap though. You can do traditional on chain atomic swaps without any middleman.
But essentially, the middleman here is helping provide the liquidity where they're accepting
the on chain deposit. And there's a little bit of cryptographic magic going on with regards
to the lightning network invoice, where there's this like pre image of some data in the invoice,
such that once that invoice gets paid, they can then take possession of the on chain deposit.
So it is a trustless atomic swap, but it is going from on chain to off chain funds. So
this gives you a new way to manage liquidity. The thing is though, I think the bigger question
is like, how do we actually use this technology? How do we make this technology easy for someone
to just click a button and have it all happen under the hood? Because if you're requiring
people to go out and find a liquidity provider somewhere and manage the sort of peer to peer
aspects of it, that's not going to be a very user friendly experience. And so they have
this software that you can run that basically enables you to become a liquidity provider.
I cannot speak much more to how well it works because I haven't actually tried out the software
myself. So it's still mostly theoretical from my perspective.
Yeah. And this, again, this is very interesting, you know, batching together using some, some
technologies that we already have and ideas, concepts we already have, combining it with
the lightning network seems to be really fascinating. I mean, batching all of these inputs together
with signature aggregation, and it is a bit of a chicken and egg, you know, kind of problem
that we have here with lightning, you know, because, and even with Bitcoin when it comes
to merchants, but really with lightning too, when it comes to liquidity, you know, it would
be easier to have more people, easier to get liquidity if more people were on the lightning
network. But of course, to get more people in the lightning network, you need more liquidity.
So it's a bit of a chicken and egg. But the same, the thing that solves this problem every
single time, guys, is simply time, right? So time and allowing more people to adopt
to the system over time. So this is really interesting. You know, I really think that
what's cool about this technology is that it's kind of future proof. So it's right now,
it's prepared to using, to be used with amps, right? Atomic multipath payments. These essentially
allow a user to receive multiple transactions as if they were one of reducing the on-chain
cost of sending multiple transactions to the same party. But it's also ready to go for,
you know, for future things like Schnorr, to be able to improve it even more. So that
is really interesting to see. Because remember, this is using all these previous technologies
that we were talking about. Like, what is it? Let's see if I have a list of all of the
ones that are happy. There was, I had a list, there were so many in here, but of course,
I got it. I got it. Go ahead, man. Listen, Gabriel. Okay. Well, first of all, lightning
loop, right? So hyperloop is a development on top of lightning loop. Lightning loop was
created, I believe, certainly using, like you said, the amps, atomic multipath payments,
but also MuSig, which is the new multi-signature protocol that was created by Greg Maxwell,
I believe. And that, but that depends on, that serves as a building block for Taproot.
And but, and then Schnorr and Taproot are going to both make hyperloop more efficient.
So like, you know, I actually wanted to, can I chime in now? And Gabriel, you already have,
man. Go ahead. Okay. Yeah. Because something you said, I really wanted to talk about here.
And this is so important to understand for anybody into Bitcoin and anybody into software,
you know, free open source software, FOSS, as they call it. One of the things that makes
it so incredibly powerful is this combinatorial aspect where you never know what individuals
are going to think of, you know, developers are constantly looking to improve things,
make new things and make things more efficient. And there's this, the idea of the layered
protocols and inventions being created that are independent from one another and can be
used modularly and can, and stacks, as they call them, software stacks. That's because
protocols that are developed in layers are much easier to work with than, than many other
structures. So over time, we've all kind of zeroed in on this approach of layered protocols
with free open source software. And because nobody is, you know, Schnorr is an example
of a non-FOSS that whose, you know, legal entanglements finally ran out and now free
open source software projects can use it. And because it wasn't part of the open source
ecosystem, everybody in the world was losing out on the huge efficiencies that this amazing
invention, you know, supplies to the world. So, but everything else, you know, involved
with Bitcoin is totally open source. So we're, we're having these situations where all these
examples that you found today are built on these incredible protocols. I mean, you go
all the way back to, you know, simple cryptographic primitives from the ancient world all the
way up through the 19th century with Charles Babbage, who created the very first mechanical
computers and he really kind of, you know, laid out the ideas that led a hundred years
later in the mid 20th century to Alan Turing, who created in a white paper, the idea of
a quote unquote universal machine. Today what we call a computer, which was the word they
used back then for people with slide rules doing math. Now we use this for the quote
unquote universal machine. And every step along the way, then we had the networking
inventions through the mid 20th century. Everything's been building up, building up, building, building
up 2008 Bitcoin was invented. And now we have lightning, you know, from 28 years after that.
And now we're building all these new things that are, and people are not randomly coming
up with stuff. I mean, yes, maybe more on the math side. They're like, Hey, let's make
an even more efficient cryptographic primitives or something. That's the most abstract side.
Then there's the most practical side where the UX people are like, how can we like hide
this stuff so that regular people who don't understand this stuff can use it, you know,
and all the way to, you know, you know, highly efficient things in these amazing new inventions.
So I just want to point that out that this combinatorial aspect of free open source software
is possibly its most salient and powerful feature. It's by combinatorial, you have to
recognize the power of exponential math, where if you have two things, okay, then you can
make four combinations, right? If you have 16 things, though, you can make thousands
and thousands and thousands and thousands of combinations. And that's kind of what we're
seeing here with these amazing inventions. So Hyperloop is really cool. You know, lightning
has some, as in its raw form, as well understood by Joseph Poon and Tad Straja, who invented
it, they knew that there was a lot of blank spots that made the usability challenging
and that it was the raw kind of concept that needed to get out there. And there's a bunch
of things like, you know, balancing the amounts and channels, being able to receive, which
we'll talk about in the next subject, you know, there's a lot of, you know, pain points
with lightning. And but the thing is that everybody that really understands this technology,
when lightning came out, ah, they knew that lightning, the lightning paper is actually
by far the hardest part. And filling in the gaps is actually easier. So all the naysayers
who were like, it's not going to be usable, were countered by the supporters saying, hey,
yeah, you're right, it's not that usable. But all these 11 weaknesses of lightning are
way easier to solve than the original hash time locked concept, you know, contract concept
that, you know, they that they came up with. So that's kind of what we're seeing here is
this amazing combinatorial explosion, which is the term they use in biology of amazing
inventions where, yeah, all of these incredible inventions are now being put together. And
they're solving all the problems that we have in Bitcoin that are pain points for usability
and efficiency and everything else.
Absolutely. I mean, again, guys, example of iterative improvements. This being able to
this affecting liquidity, you know, there's a lot of people that are like, look, lightning
will never work because we have to auto because we have to balance our own channels. But look,
people are already writing algorithms to auto balance channels and wallets. And that's going
to be a big thing as well, coming down the pipe. So I try to tell people that are trying
to like do the math on how many, you know, transactions that lightning can support and
versus on chain with the current size to be able to figure out if lightning can scale
or not. And I try to tell people guys, that is useless. There's going to be things that
we're going to invent that is going to provide order of magnitude efficiencies. So Hyperloop,
in my opinion, is one of those things where we're talking about aggregate, we could be
aggregating what snores in there, you know, thousands, tens of thousands, maybe millions
of signatures, millions of these transactions of lightning in a single transaction, sorry,
millions of these, you know, interactions in a single transaction. So this is just really,
really, really important to keep an eye on to understand that Bitcoin doesn't move like
this. Okay, it freaking is like s it is as s curve type of iterative like what Gabriel
was talking about, but with these exponential increases. So this is, this is not the last,
this is not the first. And we're going to see many more of these things. So great comments
so far, guys. Patrick, let's go to you finally on this topic and get your thoughts on this.
Yeah, I was gonna say as a signature aggregation, obviously is a huge for a lot of reasons.
I mean, it doesn't just affect this, you know, we're also it's also going to affect coin
joins in the future. And then, you know, any type of any type of batching and transaction
batching. And I will say that I believe that this the problem, the UX challenges here are
going to be solved. And the reason I think that is because when you look at what's happening
with coin join right now with like wasabi and the samurai will, they are they are solving
all the UX problems with coordinating multi parties in these types of transactions, I
don't. So I, I really think that these are, these are going to be minor issues, and that
there will be a UX will be developed that will be very easy for users to enter into
these multi party setups. So they can open, you know, get channel liquidity. Those are
the two main points. But I also want to say that, you know, in my opinion is that lightning
is already a huge game changer, even if there was no further innovations on it. I believe
that as it stands right now, lightning is incredibly functional and useful. And already,
you know, you can open large channels now, and the liquidity is there to route payments.
Pretty much I haven't really had issues for the last year routing payments personally.
And with liquidity, and it's only getting better and better just, you know, and even
though if you look on like one ml.com, and you see that like the channel liquidity, the
actual like public liquidity is actually there's less now if you look at that chart. However,
the it's the quality not quantity here as well. So quality is really important when
it comes to channel liquidity. Yeah, so I'm just really optimistic for this feature. I'm
also I just I think all these UX challenges will be solved in time. And yeah, naysayers
are going to continue to naysay. But like, like you guys have pointed out, this is open
source software and people are building on it, whether people like it or not, it's going
to happen.
Patrick, what determines the quality of a lightning channel versus obviously quantity
is obvious?
Yeah, I mean, I think that Ellen big has written quite a bit on this and done a lot of experimentation.
I know that I'm sure Jameson's really interested in this because of casa and it's ultimately
those those connections, those channel connections between parties, you know, is it is it note
up note uptime? You know, are these are the are the channel fee rates, you know, are the
routing fees, you know, set? How are those set? How do those play into how liquidity
is routed? I actually believe people should be raising their routing fees and not lowering
them. I think that raising them is better because, you know, I want to see I want to
see what people are willing to pay it around. I personally am happy to pay more money to
route if it's going to route better. So I just I really believe that like lightning
is a beautiful market based solution to liquidity and getting making the UX of making payments
with Bitcoin totally solved. I mean, you can the instant transactions, the private transactions,
all these things on lightning are what make it really useful. I don't know why people
keep thinking you can do this stuff on chain. No one's going to wait. No one's going to
wait for 10, you know, 1030 minutes for a block when they can just use lightning and
they have an instant settlement. I mean, it's a no brainer. So yeah, you know, that's my
opinions about lightning. But and I just firmly believe that all these these UX problems around
Hyperloop and courting multi parties, I don't think it's going to be a problem at all.
Yeah, Jameson, any final comments on that? In response to that?
I think liquidity is going to be one of the bigger challenges. Really, I wrote about that
like three years ago, it's being one of the bigger unknowns of sort of the topology of
the network and how it's going to evolve over time. And what tools can we build to better
understand liquidity issues and prevent certain types of liquidity attacks that I don't think
have even really even happened yet. There's certainly some interesting things that could
happen if a well funded attacker tried to start screwing with the I guess the the balance
of liquidity at not just a micro level, but even a macro level and trying to like imbalance
a lot of channels to try to like split the network in various ways. So these these various
tools for rebalancing channels and allowing them to be more long lived and and will also
make them more robust against various types of liquidity attacks that could cause routing
issues on the network. So it's a really complicated problem. And I'm not aware of any similar
type of problem that has ever been done before that like, you know, there's certainly been
plenty of networking challenges that have been addressed over the years with the internet
in general, but I'm not aware of any networking with this type of liquidity issue on top of
it.
Yep, absolutely, man. When protocols can have value, that is very, very interesting. Thanks
a lot. But for that, I really appreciate it. I think we can move on to our final subject
of the day, guys. Before we do that, please, again, I would ask if you are listening to
the audio, please go ahead and give us a review on Apple iTunes. And if you guys are on YouTube,
then definitely give us a thumbs up. And if you missed the show, make sure to guys make
sure to definitely join us in the comments below, guys. And of course, if you'd like

sure to check out our website, CryptoCast.network, where you can find our donation address. So
thanks again, guys. And of course, you can always add tips in the YouTube chat there
with the super chat as well. So let's go ahead and move on to our final topic. It's been
a very technical show, guys. And I'm really looking forward to this topic as well. Again,
I mean, Bitcoin, guys, it's technical. This is the stuff we care about. This is really,
really important stuff. We don't talk too much about stablecoins on this channel and
STOs and LEOs and whatever else we have today. But this is important stuff, guys. So final
topic today, we've got state chains. State chains scaling idea has been released. A novel
layer two non-custodial off-chain Bitcoin transfer protocol has been proposed. And this
is pretty interesting. I want to get everybody's thoughts on this because this is another layer
two scaling protocol, similar to Lightning as far as the layer goes, another layer two
scaling idea, which is facilitated by a multi-sig federation, which never has complete control.
So it is a little bit kind of like the liquid sidechain federation there. But it is interoperable
with the Lightning network. So it does allow the opening, rebalancing, closing of channels
to occur off-chain in these state chains. And it can actually even make a Lightning
on-boarding instant. So let's go to Gabriel first on this, to change it up here. Gabriel,
what are your thoughts on this particular idea of state chains? Is this a real scaling
solution? And how is this different or better than sidechains?
Well, going back to the aesthetics of it, I forgot to mention what a great name Hyperloop
is. Of course, they're making a joke about their Elon Musk train thing underground, like
a vacuum train thing. Of course, it's built on Lightning Loop. And the idea of the loop
was that they wanted to make sure the inbound and outbound liquidity were able to be balanced.
So you had to create a loop there where they could kind of talk to each other. And then
they're like flushing it out more. So of course, it's a Hyperloop, which is very cute. Coming
back to the state chains, I like anything chain is kind of like a fun word, obviously
blockchain. But state chains is really, I like that. I like state, because you're doing
something with the state. I like that name for some reason. But yeah, this is an interesting
proposal from Ruben Somsen. I'm a little bit familiar with his work because he's been presenting
and stuff for over a year. But it's different from Lightning. So this really plays into
the centralized to decentralized spectrum, which Bitcoin, well, the internet itself really
like planted a flag where TCPIP is very decentralized. Obviously, the World Wide Web is something
we would describe as sort of middle ground between a private corporation and the internet
itself where the web is like a semi, it's relatively centralized. It's got a little
bit of a sort of federation aspect to it, maybe not in the center between centralized.
The web is pretty like as far as domain registration and stuff, it's pretty centralized, the domain
registries and everything, possibly getting less and certainly in the future, we'll have
ways to decentralize it more. Bitcoin, very decentralized, we could say close to as decentralized
as the internet TCPIP, which is fantastic. There's really hardly anything else out there
between 68 and 2008 that was as decentralized of a system as Bitcoin and the internet. And
then Lightning, really quite decentralized. There's some risks of a little bit of centralization,
possibly with hubs or possibly with node creation and routing and stuff, but it's very decentralized
and that was one of the reasons why we were all so excited about it when the white paper
came out three years ago. Then we have Liquid, which came out, Blockstream Corporation created
it. It's a federation. It's pretty centralized, but yet it is definitely a bit less centralized
than many other solutions and has a lot of safeguards built into it. Once again, we're
exploring that middle ground that hardly had anything in it just before the last few years.
That's what state chains is. It's something in the middle, which is once again, exploring
new territory in the decentralized spectrum. It's not really possible to quantify a lot
of those aspects, people. But this is a general sort of conversation. Ambiguously speaking,
this is kind of a little bit more centralized than Lightning, so people might have issues
with it because it's got a little bit more trust. There's possibly more risks of people
trying to rip you off, but it does have safeguards and they're obviously very aware of the safeguards
working to put as many safeguards in as they can to prevent problems with the transfers
that happen between the entities. The centralization is the state chain entity. It's kind of like
a federation and then there's the users that communicate with it. This is an amazing, once
again, combinatorial example with this sort of semi-decentralized situation. There's so
many, just like Bitcoin itself, put together all these different cryptographic techniques
from the 70s through 2001 for that paper and then with some unique inventions in the code
like the difficulty adjustment. Same thing here with Rubin. He's put together a number
of amazing Bitcoin inventions together in a new configuration that's very cool. He's
using L2, which we already discussed first, which is amazing. He's got adapter signatures,
which is a type of scriptless script, which comes out of the anonymous MimbleWimble paper.
Some of these things are actually dependent on bips that haven't even come through yet,
so this is a still relatively abstract protocol. It's not quite possible to use yet. There's
lightning interoperability, so it's amazing because you have these protocols. Not only
can you build stuff on top of things, but then if they're in the same layer or in a
separate area, you can create interoperability situations where they're completely independent,
where not one thing builds on the top of another, but they just have their separate data silos
that still can have interoperability. That's amazing because there are two layer two protocols
that can make each other better because they're different from each other and they have different
trade-offs and different abilities, which is totally amazing. Especially state chains
is good for the onboarding and offboarding for lightning channels, so it makes it even
that much smoother. You don't need to have the liquidity already to open channels, things
like that. It's also utilizing blind signatures. This is because you want to protect your privacy
as a user. You're communicating with these state chain entities where normally they would
be able to see everything, but with blind signatures, they can't see anything, so you
have a situation where it's completely blind. They have no idea what you're doing. You have
100% privacy and then over tour, it can't be leaked either or it's harder to leak. Then
of course, it will be Schnorr signatures, which are aggregation signatures, and graph
root, which is like a really complex thing that's so hard for me to wrap my head around
because it's so low level, but apparently state chains can also utilize that. This is
a huge long list of different inventions. That's just the main layer. Of course, each
one of those depends on many amazing technological primitives that built up that, but this is
this amazing multi-sig system where you create these incentives or disincentives to theft
and you gain, of course, instant transaction and highly private transactions. That's my
summation there.
That's awesome stuff, man. So much technologies, guys. Sidechain, Schnorr, adapter signatures,
blind signatures, L2, graph root. This is what we talk about, iterative development.
Over years, this type of stuff can be built. These type of technologies cannot be built
in the traditional manner where you get investment. You come up with something, you get investment,
and then you go and try to build it. That's not quite how these technologies are going
to be built, and these open source technologies continue to be built in just that free open
source realm. That is where the most amount of information, in my opinion, can be transferred
in the least amount of time. So that's what we get. We get a really high signal to noise
ratio in open source software.
So let's go with you next on this, Jameson. So what is your comments on this so far? And
I have kind of a specific question for you, Jameson. How would you compare this to like
Chaumium cash? And is this better or worse than that?
Right. So I think an initial question is, what is the state chain actually doing? Well,
in Bitcoin, there's no such thing as a Bitcoin. There are just transaction outputs and there
are transaction outputs that have been spent, and then there are transaction outputs that
are unspent. And it's the unspent transaction outputs that are actually the Bitcoins. Now,
when you're using state chain, you're basically entering into this two of two multi-sig smart
contracts. And the state chain, I forget what they called it, but basically the entity,
the controller, the federation, what have you, that is on the other end of that two
of two multi-sig.
Entity.
Yeah. The entity allows you to really swap ownership of your UTXO with something else,
some other UTXO. It might not even be a Bitcoin UTXO. Once you add in some of the privacy
features that they're saying that they're working on, then you do essentially end up
with a blinded Chaumian eCache server. And Chaumian eCache is great from a privacy perspective
and from a scalability perspective. The downside is that it relies upon a single server that
could potentially cease to exist and prove all of your money is gone. So at least with
the state chain set up, you get those privacy and scalability benefits, but you no longer
have the trusted aspect of it, where if the entity cease to exist, you still have ways
to recover your funds on chain by broadcasting transactions. So I guess the real question
is, what will this be used for? Will it be used for mixing? Will it be used for decentralized
exchange? Will it be used as some sort of new entry way and sort of on and off ramp
to lightning network? There's definitely a number of different possibilities there. And
I guess the real question will come down to incentives of, will we see many of the state
chain entities operating? What is the risk to the entities? What income can they make
from offering these services? This is assuming that all the underlying technology is sound
and a lot of it is still fairly theoretical, then I think it's mostly going to come down
to incentives of, what are people going to benefit from operating these services and
from using these services? And there's definitely plenty of potential there, but it could be
years before we really see these things get used in mainstream usage.
Absolutely. It's kind of funny how people still talk about mainstream. And we were just,
so I just, I try to tell all the time, James, I try to tell people all the time, it's early
days, but nobody seems to listen to me. Everybody seems to want 4K video in 1995. And it's just
really, really strange talking about, we've got to bring this to the mainstream. We have
to get this to the main. We have to get this to more people. And it's like, no, I try to
tell people that, look, Bitcoin is going to evolve just like the internet did at the pace
that is comfortable with the internet. It's really all market-based at this point. So
if more people want more bandwidth, well, there's going to be more companies that create
more ISPs and create better bandwidth. So as Bitcoin gets bigger and bigger, the incentives
will grow larger and larger and Bitcoin will get more and more into the mainstream as the
market wants it. Again, this is, for the most part, free market-based behavior here, guys.
So Bitcoin is absolutely early, early, guys. I try to say we're around circa like 1991,
maybe 92, because we're still using so many of these command-line interfaces and there's
still so much more protocol development that has to still be put into the base layer here
for Bitcoin to really shine in the future as this private new money outside of the state.
So I am really looking forward to shows like this and technologies like this that we've
discussed on this show that come because this shows that Bitcoin continues to iterate, continues
to evolve, and is not slowing down or stopping anytime soon, guys. This is the money that
the market is choosing to be that secondary choice to fiat. And this is, I don't think,
again, it's going to slow anytime soon. So great comments so far, guys.
Patrick, last but not least, my friend, let's get you in here for this last topic. Go ahead.
Yeah, I think this is really interesting technology. Like we were mentioning earlier, this is technology
is going to fill in more gaps of usability in various places in the software that we
don't maybe have yet. As James had mentioned, Bitcoins are like UTXOs. They're these unspent
transaction outputs. And really what this is doing is allowing people to lock these
UTXOs and then pass these UTXOs around to each other off chain. And then that final
user can withdraw that UTXO without the permission. So there are definitely some benefits. The
downsides seem to be that you have to deal with these whole UTXOs for the most part.
The upsides being that you have a lot of freedom to do with what you want to do with those
UTXOs once it's in the state chain, which opens up a bunch of different use cases like
this article basically mentions. Maybe this will have opportunities for doing decentralized
like betting or Oracle-based stuff. Using colored coins maybe makes sense to have UTXOs
of like a colored coin or something like that where you're working with these very small
amounts. And as long as people are dealing with one unit, if it's a bunch of single units
passing around, maybe that's how it will be used for some type of Chowmein decash functionality.
There's basically coin join. Essentially, it's similar to coin join where everyone kind
of puts their UTXOs in and then the mixing happens. So this is essentially could be evolved
to work in a sort of coin join fashion as well. So there's just a lot of unknowns I
think how this is going to be used. But I really think it's cool technology. I'm fascinated
to see what the next use case or the first use case that comes out of this.
It's really crazy to see. Every couple of years, just more of these amazing technologies
for Bitcoin come out. People like to say that there's not a whole lot of innovation on Bitcoin,
but then you see all of these papers every single year. And it's just crazy. I'm pretty
much only pay attention to Bitcoin. And this is pretty much a full time job. So I wouldn't
even have time to pay attention to anything else because so much continues to happen in
Bitcoin. And guys, again, these are some of the three different technologies that we talked
about today. But just these three technologies alone enable dozens of new use case scenarios,
could possibly enable orders of magnitude scaling in the next few years. This is such
important stuff, guys. And again, this is basically about the least of sexy of stuff
that you can get. This is not Ethereum 2.0, guys. We're not going to have unicorns up
on the stage. But this is the stuff that these people are working on. Literally, I like to
say all the time, Bitcoin is the Mount Everest, guys, of engineering. And it attracts the
most intelligent people in the space and on the planet that are working on this stuff.
And I have been working on this stuff for many, many, many years. So thanks again, guys.
I really, really appreciate it for joining. I think we can end it here. Let's go ahead
and say goodbye to our guest, Patrick. Where can we find out more about you, sir?
Yeah, I mean, just follow me on Twitter. I think my latest handle on Twitter is probably
the last one. I won't change it in the future. But at P underscore Miller underscore on Twitter,
feel free to follow me. And yeah, I just generally tend to talk about technical topics. That's
kind of why I'm on Twitter. I'm really not on Twitter. So I can be social with a bunch
of random people on the internet. I really am on Twitter. So I can get into this signal.
Because I found that's where that's where, you know, it's really easy to hone the signal
by following the right people and blocking the wrong people.
You're one of the toxic Mexilists out there. All right. You guys follow Patrick, guys.
He's got a lot of great technical tweets that he does tweet all the time. I retweet Patrick
all the time. So make sure you check him out. Mr. Gabriel divine. Where can we find out
more about you, sir? You can find out more about me in Patrick's
living room with his lamp there. I really like it, actually. No, I am also available
on Twitter to have stupid weird conversations. I am mostly there to talk to stupid random
people on the internet, usually about Bitcoin. And my username on Twitter is Gabriel divine,
letter D, V, I, N, E. And you can also send me a direct message once again, if you want
to solicit me to shill stuff, I will be very entertained by that and reject you. But I
will love it. No, but I feel free to jump in and say hi.
I really appreciate a few messages that I get occasionally where people say that they
appreciated my commentary. And that's very encouraging to me. It makes me want to do
more shows with like this with Vortex. And I'd like to also say that it's been wonderful
to be on with a couple of intellectual luminaries, Patrick and Jameson. So that's been an honor.
Absolutely man. I can listen to you guys talk all day. I could listen to all three of you
guys talk all day about Bitcoin. This is some fascinating stuff. And yeah, Gabriel, I tell
you, you always bring back the DMS, the 2017 DMS, man. That was absolutely nuts. You know,
just people offering tens of thousands of dollars to either be, you know, on the top,
what do you call it? An advisor on the top of the coin or just to simply promote the
coin. So yeah, it's just crazy stuff, crazy stuff. All right, Jameson, we all know and
love you, man. But let the world know where can we find out more about you, sir?
It's LOP on Twitter. That's L-O-P-P or LOP.net where you can find my educational resources
and attempt to contact me either by expending 30 seconds of proof of work in your CPU or
by sending me a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin to show me that you mean it.
Nice, man. I got to start doing that guys. Holy crap, Jameson. That's pretty smart. So
if you want to contact Jameson, you better be, it better be a serious, serious question.
This guy doesn't have time for amateur stuff. So really awesome, Jameson. Thanks again,
man. So much for being on. Really, really appreciate it guys. These guys are donating
their time. Of course we don't pay them or anything to get on the show. Of course I don't
get paid. This is a YouTube, a community supported YouTube channel. So again, guys, thanks so
much. If you do enjoy content like this, please think about donating over there, checking
out our CryptoCast.network website. We would really appreciate it. So until next time guys,
we'll be talking Bitcoin. We'll see you later. Bye bye.

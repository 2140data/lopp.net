Tell me the history of bitcoin maximalism. I don't know if we have enough time for that.
You know I have lived through it and I'm pretty sure someone who actually researched that period
I'm wondering what kind of things I did not notice but yeah it would be a nice nice story I think.
It's you know sociological phenomenon which is not my forte but like you said we've lived through
it and now we're just trying to understand it and explain it and hopefully be able to get some
sort of idea of where it's going from here but I think it's always going to be evolving and
we're going to be surprised by which you know new factions rise and fall over the years.
So you wrote an article about it right you just recently retweeted it.
What's that about? I think the the gist of it is that it has natural logical beginnings and
evolutions over the years of how we've ended up where we are today basically that it really spawned
off of the first era of altcoins which were just you know bitcoin with a few parameters tweaked
and you know that's when the concept of shitcoin really arose in that oh you're just making a knock
off of bitcoin that has you know no meaningful additional utility or value and then it's it's
all just marketing of you trying to accrue value and you know compete with the bitcoin network but
you know over the years altcoins had the whole altcoin space has exploded gotten a lot more
sophisticated yes I would say the vast majority of them are you know cheap pump and dump scams but
there are some projects out there that are actually putting in work and trying to do novel
things and the some you know faction of bitcoiners prefer to just remain you know focused on bitcoin
and automatically dismiss all other attempts at doing anything with cryptography in this space
so it has become I think more and more of a virtue signaling type of issue of saying you
know we're not even going to give other projects the time of day because we believe that in some
sense or another it's competing with bitcoin whether that's for the monetary value or just
time and attention value and you know bitcoin is the only thing
worth spending any resources on so it seems like it's turned into less of an interesting like
technical debate of whether or not any of these projects are doing interesting new things and more
of ideological debate and and you know those ideological factions have in some cases become
more and more extreme as as new cohorts come in and I think this is a natural result of
you know self-selection and narratives and mimetics evolving over the years
it's not unlike any other sort of cultural or even religious narratives and you know you can
even go back in history and look at different religions and how they've forked off over centuries
and millennia so I think that this was naturally going to happen and it's just a question of
you know how do we approach it you know are you gonna fight against it or just say hey you know
this this is human sociology and you know call it out for what it is and you can choose to participate
in you know whatever narratives and ideology you want you know there are actually some some more
practical things here uh other than than than sociology here because I noticed when over the
years I have been I created or and or moderated different bitcoin cryptocurrency related groups
and and and you know I'm I'm a busy person I'm doing this as a hobby and stuff and and and you
just have I'm a shitcoiner I don't really touch shit coins but but I'm not against them
I yeah I hope they they they they they can come up with something great but but you know I had to
make the judgment cause and I cannot review every single post there so if it's
outcoin like I I just gonna guess and and delete right away and get home with my day so that was
my experience at least even though I didn't want to push bitcoin maximalism I am pushing it I have
another very interesting question for you so as you know I'm I am a privacy researcher for
10 years at this point and as I recall you have had some privacy problems back in the day
can you tell me about that what happened right so you know my privacy journey is interesting
because it's really flipped around over the decades in my early career before I went full-time
building bitcoin and self custody systems I actually spent a decade as an an email engineer
at a marketing company and specifically over the years I went from being more of a front-end
developer to being more of a back-end large data analysis engineer so this was like the early days
of cloud computing in the late 2000s when it was just becoming a thing of what you know cloud even
was and and so essentially I was one of the guys responsible for you're stripping away people's
privacy in a sense because my task was to take petabytes and petabytes of raw analytics information
that was getting collected as a result of the emails that were being sent out and opened and
clicked on and tracked in a variety of different ways and to basically use our large-scale
distributed data systems to analyze that data and provide metrics analytics and even sort of
predictive algorithms that we could then sell to marketers so that they could basically more
efficiently target and sell whatever they were trying to sell to you know the people who were
most likely to buy whatever they were trying to sell so you know that gave me a lot of insight
into just how poor your privacy is on a day-to-day basis of using the internet and the sort of
default setup that people do and you know after I'd been in bitcoin working for a couple of years
and started to accrue a number of followers on twitter and piss people off during the
scaling debates I ended up getting visited by a swat team they shut down my entire neighborhood
of like 400 houses at the time because someone decided that they wanted to screw with me and
extort me and that really led me to realize how exposed I was physically you know not just from
a digital sense but like people could actually physically find me and you know try to threaten
and harm me so it took me about a year after that incident of researching can you slow down for a
moment there sure what happened exactly so swat team went to your house you were home you were not
home your family well what's what's going on there yeah I was kind of lucky when it actually
happened because I I had some slight operational security practices and that you know for example
when I would post something with a photo or a location I would only do that after I had already
left that location and in other times I would post things that people might then assume that I was
doing something so for example what happened on this day I it was a Monday morning and I got up
and I went to the gym as my routine was to do usually around six o'clock in the morning
and as soon as I got to the gym I tweeted something about how it was you know Monday morning we had
a whole another week of you know scaling debates arguing ahead of us and went and I did my workout
showered came back to my house and I actually got I ran into a police blockade trying to get back
into my neighborhood and so it took probably 20 or 30 minutes of me sitting there and then
eventually you know talking to the police more of understanding you know what this sort of active
shooter incident was until we realized that I was the active shooter that they were looking for
um and you know thankfully was able to explain what was going on of like I knew what swatting
was I just you know never thought it was going to happen to me and you know what had happened was
of course the attacker saw my tweet and assumed you know it's so early in the morning I must have
just gotten out of bed I must still be at home and so I was lucky from that sense that I actually
ran into the police you know not inside of my home as opposed to them busting down the door
with guns and being you know a hair trigger something could have gone wrong you know if
myself as a is a firearm owner who actually at the time had about a dozen
rifles laid out in my living room because I had been to the shooting range the previous day
and I was planning on cleaning my guns you know it could have been you know a nasty ending if if
not for that one particular little tidbit of me posting when I wasn't at home but yeah this was
a wake-up call it could have gone worse and I wanted to prevent it from happening again
and you know that's when I really started going down the privacy rabbit hole and what did you do
go to another place leave another place not posting about it anymore not telling well yeah so
not take pictures there yeah there were you know a couple different paths in front of me I could have
just you know deleted my twitter account deleted all of my online presence and gone underground and
basically no longer presented myself as a public persona that could be targeted but I didn't want
to throw away the reputation that I already built for many years under my real name so I decided
to take what is arguably a much harder path and that was basically you know how do I continue
using my my government name but in such a way that I cannot be targeted by just any random person
who you know spends 20 or 30 dollars going to you know one of the various data brokerages and name
lookup services be able to you know find all of my credit information and other personal information
to to then you know target my actual house and you know the only way that I really found that
that was possible was to burn down every publicly registered thing that was associated with me so
in the United States we call it real property but that's things like your house and your vehicle
you know large value assets that get publicly registered and create a lot of records that
then of course get sucked into various databases so basically yeah I had to move to a different
place I had to you know I had to sell all of my assets that were you know tied to my name all
my physical assets and then I had to purchase new assets but not under my own name I had to
create you know legal trusts and corporations and structure them in such a way that my name
is not on any of the publicly registered documents so you know any assets that I have are just under
various innocuous sounding corporations and trusts that hopefully no one would be able
to associate with me because those names are not associated with me in any other way and the the
short version of it is I had to sort of look at every aspect of my life like everything that
could be used to connect to me you know things like phone numbers for example and basically set up
proxies so you know a proxy you generally think of a proxy in sort of a technical sense of like oh
I'm gonna you know set up a proxy server that's basically rerouting traffic but you know you can
have proxies in a variety of different ways so for example I consider like even these legal entities
as sort of proxies they're basically obfuscating you know the true ownership of assets for phone
numbers I have proxies where it's basically I have multiple SIM cards but I don't even know
the phone numbers associated with those SIM cards I have a sort of a ring of proxy voiceover IP
numbers that sit in front of them that are the numbers I actually give out to various people
and services and then those you know forward the calls along and I can rotate these out as needed
I can spool up new ones to create you know essentially new pseudonyms as needed and you know
firewall off the different aspects of my life
and then you know even like using attorneys friends family as proxies for other aspects
it gets really complicated and I would say that in that first year I spent tens of thousands of
dollars in legal fees mostly to set all of this stuff up and it is still an ongoing cost
thousands of dollars a year at the minimum just to you know keep the corporations and the trusts
going and to you know pay for additional services that otherwise you know most people would not
be using you know I might might have ended up in a similar situation regarding the samurai people
you know they they have been sending me death threats since forever right but the last
habit that they get into is to to keep posting my my parents address I suspect that they think
that that's that's my address but I'm not sure I mean anyway so they kept posting it and it
got to a get a point where T dev have my parents address was his twitter location right so it's
like holy fucking shit but anyway they got in jail so no need to go to the extent that you did
yeah I mean that is another sort of issue of you know even if you set up all of this amazing
privacy for yourself it's highly unlikely that you will convince your extended family
or other people who are associated with you to do the same and you know you can't protect everybody
unfortunately um all right so this this series is about bitcoin and has the reason is because I
started the rejuvenation olympics interview series so that's about people trying to slow down their
aging and and I felt like I'm moving too far away from bitcoin and somehow maybe I could I could
bring the two together and and and see find some bitcoiners who who did some something
quite significant in in health and I recalled you had an article back in the day called
fat to fit and and I would like to talk about that but I would also be curious
uh what what happened since then so let me let me set the stage a couple of years ago you
you went down from I translated it to Europeans so don't worry from 94 kilogram to 79 kilogram
uh 34 body fat fat percentage to 21 body fat percentage and 114 centimeter
waist circumference to 90 centimeter and all these in four months now I think 34
body fat percentage to 21 body fat percentage in four months is is is the crazy number here for me
yeah and and one year later you you still kept kept it so so tell me about that
how did how did it came about well you know it started in the middle of COVID lockdowns
it was probably like six to eight months into the COVID saga so you know late 2020 I started
thinking um you know how do I protect myself from COVID and when I looked at the various mortality
metrics it seemed to me like the the biggest issue that you had to worry about in terms of like
co-morbidity is just obesity um you know the people who were essentially you know suffocating
to death as a result of having you know lung deterioration with COVID seemed like a lot of
them were either you know extremely elderly and frail or they were just extremely overweight
and so you know I wasn't elderly but I knew I was overweight and I figured the the most
proactive thing that I could do would be just you know improve my overall health there so that
if and when I contracted COVID I would my body would be in a better position to fight it off
and so that's when I started looking into okay how do I actually do this with as least effort as
possible that was my other thing is you know I didn't want to go crazy on having to spend a
ton of time you're counting calories and tracking a lot of things and so I think that was the main
impetus of you know how how do I do this as easily as possible and you know we can get into I guess
whether or not it really is low effort or easy but some of my own um I guess quirks allow me to be
a bit more extreme in some of my habits than maybe the average person so that helped but
I think it it came down to you know simplicity as well as what's the most straightforward simple
way to improve my health or at least reduce my fat and so that was that was my primary goal for
that first period and then over the years I've started experimenting with other things trying
to continue to improve my health in other ways you know I noticed that obesity is it seems to be
honest you have some some some really nice devices you know um obesity is the the single
thing that one can do to lower their biological age um that's that's that's interesting even
I might even go go that far to to say even more than than working out but you know then the
worry about start to confound um so so so what's the simplest least afford way to lose a lot of
fat tell us can't wait yeah so uh I think a lot of it has more to do with cutting out bad things
from you know the the first sort of quip that you may hear a lot that I think is
actually quite accurate is that you can't outrun a bad diet and so especially in America you know
we have the the standard American diet or sad uh you know for acronym and uh you know I think that
already puts us at a big disadvantage there's just so many ultra processed foods in America that are
um stuffed with highly subsidized uh high fructose corn syrup and other other corn and
related agricultural products that I think normally would not be shoved into these foods
if the government wasn't incentivizing the farmers to produce a lot more of it um so
you know specifically I ended up choosing a ketogenic diet and you know that was mainly
because my research concluded that you know when your body goes into ketosis you really
supercharge your body processing fat as a store of energy as opposed to normally it's going to be
using carbohydrates uh to actually create your energy to power your metabolism um
but you know several years later as I've tried a few other diets I don't
necessarily believe that keto is like the perfect diet for everyone uh the reason why I think that
it works for a lot of people and the reason why I think it works for me is really because it forces
you to be mindful about what you're eating and it forces you to avoid a lot of those uh ultra
processed foods so you know basically on a ketogenic diet it means I'm eating uh meat and vegetables
and maybe a little bit of fruit but you know just that of you know cutting out uh a lot of the you
know shelf stable products I think is what really did it that along with cutting out you know beer
and an alcohol you know uh you'd really want to avoid drinking your calories as well and so
mostly stick with black coffee unsweetened tea and a lot of water and so that's another thing
that I also started doing is you know carrying around essentially a gallon jug of water that has my
time of day markings on it and making sure that I'm well hydrated and I've done a little bit of
fasting as well I've tried intermittent fasting I've tried multi-day fasting and the I think that
that may be good for you know sort of resetting your body or certainly be helpful for getting
into ketosis if you're not already in it though I found that fasting while in ketosis is far easier
you generally don't get as hungry when your body is running on fat as its energy stores more of a
slow burn type of thing but um point being with the drinking all of the water is that I found that
just making sure that you're drinking a lot of water throughout the day also prevents you from
getting hungry and wanting to snack because water you know does help fill you up and especially
helps during fasting periods but while I did all of this without your specifically counting calories
or looking at macros or anything else like that I think that it was a sort of confluence of all
of these other habits that resulted in me just naturally getting my caloric intake down and
making sure that I was you know burning a lot more than I was ingesting. When you're talking about
ketogenic diet do you mean like there are two types right like a high fat or a high protein one
like which which one aren't you talking about here? So I was focused more on high fat at the time
since you know the fat was the my source of energy I wasn't really tracking my macros or you know how
much protein and fat I was getting at the time that was something I started doing a few years later
though it's annoying and I really only started tracking macros when I decided that I wanted to
start adding more muscle so you know this early experiment with ketosis I was primarily focused
on losing fat and that certainly worked and I was you know I'd started going to the gym and
lifting weights but not in any sort of highly regimented fashion I didn't really know what I
was doing I didn't have any professional advice or spend a ton of time you know coming up with a
weightlifting plan I was just going in and you know doing like three sets of macs on a variety of
different machines and whatever just to make sure I was you know actually working out my muscles but
I don't think I really gained much muscle during that and what I realized after sort of being
plateaued there for a couple of years and trying harder to gain muscle I realized that on a ketogenic
diet it's very very difficult to to gain muscle because normally you know in order to in order
to actually add muscle you can't just eat protein you also need carbohydrates to turn into I think
glucose to help get your body into a position where it can start building up your muscles that was
you know something that I started doing last year when I actually got a professional trainer
and they completely switched up my diet which has led to a whole other journey over the past year
what about the environment that you existed in at that time like is it is it still the lockdown
of it and you are not going anywhere or you were traveling around the world to be going
conferences I think it wasn't until probably several months at least after I published that
essay that we started having Bitcoin conferences again and then of course trying to stay in a
ketogenic diet while traveling and being on airplanes and stuff is also very difficult
especially when you go to Europe there's a lot of breads and pastas and so on and
it can be probably almost as difficult to be vegetarian you're trying to to stick to meat
and vegetables but you know these days I'm not actually in ketosis I'm sort of carb cycling in
and out of low carb and high carb days but not actually trying to keep my body in a state of
ketosis what about the fasting that you mentioned there like are you talking about complete fast
or protein fasting yeah basically water fasting I've done up to I want to say like two and a half
day fast just experimenting like I said doing a one or a two day fast
is a lot more doable I think when you're already in ketosis and just sticking to sort of water tea
coffee for me one of the the big improvements of being in ketosis it just feels like I have
more mental clarity and you know don't get tired as easily like I said it's more of like a slow burn
rather than you know when you're you're eating sugars or carbs at a meal you know that'll last
for a little while and then you kind of have a crash and it's just more difficult to maintain your
concentration and keep your your general level of concentration and acuity
managed I have not gotten so far as to doing like a glucose you know real-time glucose monitor
but one of the things that I have appreciated is sometime last year I got the the aura ring
and so you know that's primarily you know for sleep tracking it doesn't do as good of a job at
tracking your sort of athletic metrics but just from looking at the sleep tracking alone
I realized eating later at night drinking alcohol in the evenings these are things that
impact your sleep quite negatively and so you know that has resulted in some more behavioral
changes as well for me and also just trying to to stick to you know a more regularly scheduled
time of going to sleep you know ura gives you these these scores every day when you wake up
and I feel like they are generally accurate with just like sort of looking at how I feel myself
and I can tell you know when I'm out too late or if I'm even having like a single
glass of wine or something with dinner it has a noticeable impact on how well I sleep and this is
it's sort of like I said at the very beginning you know there's some very fundamental things
here like far more important than going to the gym is what what are you putting into your body
what are the inputs if we're looking at our body as a just sort of type of a biological
machine obviously it's all about inputs and outputs so you know what what food and what macros
what level of hydration are you getting but also on the sleep side you know how how much
and what level of quality is that sleep if you don't have those really basic foundations
then pretty much anything else you do is is going to it's not going to be as affected and so I'm also
I mean I've got a number of things in flight right now that I'm experimenting with and you know
one of them is I'm going to be trying out the the eight sleep which is basically a mattress cover
to help regulate your your temperature because I'm a really hot sleeper and especially during the
summer you know sometimes I've noted I even get get so hot that it'll wake me up in the middle
of the night so hopefully that's just like another thing to help bring more consistency
to that aspect because you know if you consider you spend like 25 to 30 percent of your your time
sleeping and that's a really important regenerative cycle for a variety of your biological processes
every night it's it's worth paying attention to yeah you might spend a month on one that to
to actually figure out what's the right temperature for you at what time of the day right when
sometimes you you you get up and go to toilet that's when you okay it's 1 a.m. and it's too
too cold then next day I'm gonna make it to armor so what the most important question
how many peers did you and do you take in a day yeah it's a funny question because it's
it's more related to an ongoing new experiment that I'm doing right during that first couple of years
I was only taking one or two pills I was taking a ketogenic specific vitamin which had things like
magnesium and potassium there you know there are certain vitamins and minerals that ketogenic diets
tend to be deficient on and you want to make sure that you you get plenty of those so
I think I was taking that ketogenic vitamin and then maybe fish oil but about a year ago
when I started messing around with some of these you know metabolic age tests and you're trying to
to look more on the longevity side of things that's when my my supplement intake exploded
I probably take over 20 pills a day at this point and I have three or four different
longevity focused companies that I am you know subscribed to and you know I do sort of blood
and stool testing to to look at various markers some of it is for gut health some of it you know
the the microbiome health and then you know the rest of it is just looking at sort of metabolic
health in general and trying to to put a number on you know is your is your metabolic age you know
higher or lower than your biological age and I haven't I haven't really settled on how I feel
about them yet because like I said I'm doing like four different companies at the same time to see
if they're even sort of in sync with each other and you know a lot of this seems to be really
early days kind of hand wavy the the science is still a bit out there uh unproven so you know
I'm not at the point yet where I would necessarily point at any one thing and say you know this is
the way that you uh improve your metabolic health by just like taking a supplement you know
obviously I think they're like drinking less alcohol helps the the weird thing is that some
of these companies are really big on veganism and just like avoiding meat altogether and that's
very difficult for me so bad flag yeah I don't know I also I went through this whole cholesterol
saga uh at the end of last year where um it was I was already having a high cholesterol
from being on a ketogenic diet which is you know completely expected but then what was unexpected
was when I got a personal trainer and they completely changed my diet it was basically
one year ago last summer they changed my diet to uh high carb and ultra high protein diet so
it was around 100 grams of carbs a day and 200 grams of protein per day and um my cholesterol
actually shot up even higher and it was so high that my uh primary doctor wanted to put me on
statins and um you know I have no history of heart issues and I ended up having to go
to a number of other doctors you know cardiologists and lipid specialists and um
basically determined that the the simple cholesterol blood tests that doctors normally
give you when you get an annual physical are not quite nuanced enough to give you a full picture
of what's happening with your cholesterol and with your cardiovascular health and
basically it's it's entirely possible to have a high LDLC level but to not uh you know have poor
cardiovascular health you know having a high LDLC could be a yellow flag and it's you know worth
looking into more but I ended up having a CT scan of my heart to check and I had a calcification
score of zero from that so basically I have no plaque build up um and also I got much more
advanced lipid panels that do things uh like look at your apolipoprotein B for example and
actually look at the size of your cholesterol particles and the reason why those things are
interesting is that if your cholesterol particle size is very large and fluffy then that's generally
considered safer whereas if you have a lot of really small particles those particles are more
likely to actually like pass through the cells of your blood vessels and you know get basically get
stuck and that's when they can calcify start to build up plaque and of course that is actually
what we care about is um you know preventing heart attacks uh and heart attacks are a result of you
know plaque building up and basically constricting your blood vessels so short version is cholesterol
is a very complicated thing and um you need to look at a variety of different markers if you
have no plaque build up then you need to look at additional cholesterol markers to get a better
understanding of what is your actual risk it is is your cholesterol like the bad type that will
you know build up and cause plaque or is it uh is it likely to just continue floating around your
body and not cause you any problems yeah I just uh just watched something about cholesterol today and
it's a kind of kind of worms for sure um you also talked about
Sarms I'm not familiar with that what's that right uh is it selective selective androgynous
receptor modulators or something like that um so Sarms the best way to think of them is that
they are uh compounds they're molecules that are steroid like um they they help bind you know to your
your your muscles your proteins essentially to to help encourage more muscle growth or
sometimes fat loss you know there's there's a variety of different uh Sarms compounds out there
um but the it's the s that the selective part that makes them more interesting than steroids so
you know I'm not a doctor but my understanding is you know steroids is basically like blasting your
whole body with this signal that just says you grow uh whereas Sarms are more uh more specific
in which which cells in your body they're targeting so you don't you don't have the same
level of of risks and negative side effects of steroids but they are riskier um you know it's
Sarms are not approved by the FDA in the US uh I I'm not sure if they're approved by any other
sort of government uh regulator authorities they're in the US generally considered a gray
market thing where you're not gonna get a doctor to tell you to use Sarms and um purchasing them
can be tricky because if you buy them you basically have to agree that it's like not for human usage
like it's it's only for you know experiments or something so um is also similar to steroids it's
not something that you want to stay on uh in perpetuity normally you do like a six or an eight
week cycle and then depending on the type of Sarms that you're doing there's uh certain post-cycle
therapies that you might still want to like take various supplements uh because they can for example
affect your testosterone levels um not as badly as steroids but you know there are still effects
there so I tried a couple of different Sarms and uh you know they definitely work um I think
the one that I found most effective was sometimes it's called ligand drawl sometimes it's called
like LGD4 um and I could tell when I was on it that I could generally feel like my heart racing
more and I just felt more energetic I could like lift heavier weights when I was at the gym and I
think it did help you know improve my uh my fat loss and possibly you know some addition of muscle
while I was doing all of that but I haven't done them since then um and in fact I'm going to be
trying something this summer uh with peptides which I believe are you know safer than Sarms
but once again this is a sort of gray market uh cutting edge area that's not like federally
approved or anything like that so uh you know I will be reporting back on that you know probably
next year with the results which peptides uh so the one that I am looking at starting pretty soon
is uh it's called Sarmarellen or Sarmarellen um and that's one that is you know specifically
supposed to help both with adding muscle and reducing fat mm-hmm mm-hmm the grp1 agonistar
muscles such peptides is uh new things had a had a bad experience with that uh turns out
the race race well talking about ordering your your resting heart rate was up significantly
every single night and and your heart rate variability goes down so I was trying to make
it work but uh I could not and you know you know what's crazy that uh it seems like the
internet haven't even caught up to this like only some or or of reddit forums are talking about this
but when I was looking at like studies done uh it was very consistently ruining that two things
although well they certainly ruined my sleep but on the other hand there could be an argument made
that even though it ruins the resting heart rate and heart rate variability uh the actual
head outcomes are positive yeah you know I'm not gonna test it on myself yeah I mean a lot of
these things seem to have trade-offs uh there there is no uh you know magic pill or injection
or whatever I mean I guess uh some people are playing around with like metformin and ozempic
and other stuff but uh that's new enough that I am kind of afraid that you know five or ten years
from now a lot of studies are going to come out about terrible long-term side effects of them
that that's why that's why you have to take them while they are hot
before the side effects appear yeah so it's a very interesting phenomenon in in bitcoin
just just yesterday uh there is max maxilla brand he there is a grill in the office and what he does
is he buys a lot of meat like like meat and then makes a lot of uh meat on the grill and and then
serves it and here is your meat no sides no vegetables no bread no not a full kind of meat
yeah so what's going on why are bitcoiners so fond of meat and carnivore
yeah I mean I haven't gone full carnivore myself um you know I guess the argument is that uh animal
meat is like the most highly dense um nutrient type of food that you can get out there uh you know
because you know in in general the animals that you're eating uh they have been consuming
um hopefully grass and you know regular plants that are growing out of the ground
so that you know they're essentially consuming a lot of the nutrients from the soil that are
going into the plants that are rising up that are then being eaten uh and digested by the animals
and then so the the animals and their meat themselves is a sort of higher order level of food
as opposed to you know us trying to directly eat the plants ourselves and process that
there's some interesting arguments to it uh you know I think we both know a number of people who
have essentially been living on the carnivore diet for several years I don't think I would
really want to do that myself for one because I mean I think you need fiber at the very least
you're gonna probably have some digestive issues at least what I've read from other
a number of people who did carnivore long term and then ended up stopping was usually due to
various digestive issues that came up but once again this is the type of thing where
I don't think that there's one diet that works for everyone um I did read an interesting
book a year or two ago that I think it was basically called uh Eat Right for Your Type
and the author of that book made an argument that your blood type can actually be an indicator
of like what the best type of diet for you is and this is um it is kind of hand wavy
science it's more of a like almost archaeological or historical look at human civilization and the
arguments that they were making where you know if you're if you're this specific blood type then
your ancestors you know probably came from Asia and were mostly used to eating these types of foods
and therefore your digestive system has evolved more to be uh you know of that type of food
and you know I think it made sense but once again it's not necessarily like great peer reviewed
and tested science but I will say that that book said that you know with my blood type
which is type O that ketogenic diet works really well for people of blood type O because we were
historically more of the hunter-gatherer types so you know societies that would be
semi-nomadic and uh mostly chasing animals eating meat and then also foraging uh for plants
from time to time like I said I think that people kind of need to experiment and figure out what's
best for them uh everybody's body is different and so this is why I don't go around saying oh
everyone must eat ketogenic diet or everyone should be carnivore so on and so forth so
so one of the most important question is so everyone can lose weight right I can I lose weight
like three times a year I go down 10 kilogram but but then then then I always come back so
yeah and you aren't so how did that happen uh you know I think that it has to do with how strict
you're willing to maintain uh whatever things you put in place so you know for me the nice thing
about keto was that I could basically eat whatever I wanted until I felt full uh so eat a lot of
meat and vegetables if you're hungry eat more and that it it generally was not going to add
more fat to your body itself because your your body is in you know fat processing mode you know if
if you for whatever reason you know don't have the ability to stick to more strict regimens of
diet and exercise then it can be a lot more difficult and it's not for everyone
uh yeah I think this is speaking to your diet for a very long time already huh yeah also uh
as I think I stuck to that diet pretty strictly for two and a half three years you know up until
a year ago uh now I guess what I didn't mention you know when I when I changed up my diet a year
ago and I got the personal trainer I gained uh a lot but I was also trying to bulk up that was
that was the whole idea was eating high carb high protein and and adding a lot of muscle but
also added a decent amount of fat as a part of that process so you know now once again
um experimenting with trying other things where um right now from a weight perspective and a body fat
perspective I am higher than I was you know 18 months ago and I'm I'm still trying to improve
of you know adding muscle and losing fat so that's like one of the reasons why I'm looking into
peptides to see you know if they can help it's very difficult to both add muscle and lose fat
at the same time uh you know everybody wants to do that but uh as I saw for the experiment with
the last half of last year when I added muscle I also added a lot of fat um and I could cut
but I would be afraid that if I went back to my hardcore strict keto diet
yes I would definitely lose muscle but or I would lose fat but I would probably also lose muscle
um and that's one one thing that I have noted amongst the people that I am familiar with it's
stick to strict cartivore and strict keto diets they tend to be pretty lean um you know not uh
not very high on on the muscle side of things it seems to me just from sort of anecdotal experience
looking at my own body looking at other people who are very strict about low carb diets that um
you know if you are going to do that it's going to be pretty difficult to to have a higher level
of muscle and so you know that's what I'm trying to go for right now I did the lean thing for several
years and I just want to see you know how can I reshape my body uh I think this is this is kind
of what any of us who are interested in health are trying to do is we're just playing around with
inputs and trying to figure out you know what are the inputs that lead to these outputs um
and you know I haven't found the the perfect setup quite yet that is working for me but you know
there is a lot of different variables that you can play around with there is this
training philosophy that maintenance is a myth there is no no maintenance there is only
cutting and booking maintenance doesn't exist it's just mentally too challenging um
another thing that you mentioned is the is the food the food is getting worse
now there is an interesting theory here that you know inflation is making food
worse um almost like directly because there are these things the prices are always sticky
and they never want to go up so instead of you if you're selling selling a product and
you have two choices you either uh make your product as a food product more expensive on the
shelves or you can cut some corners maybe you can put some things in it that's booking instead of
the expensive ingredient you know like so so yeah bitcoin solves your diet as well turns out
yeah I mean there's uh your shrinkflation uh the the you know package sizing is generally getting
smaller while keeping the prices the same and then there's just sort of the issue of fillers
for example like we've even seen with a lot of the grated cheeses in America using uh basically
cellulose or in other words you know plant material uh and putting that into the cheese
as a filler and um you know since I was pretty much avoiding a lot of processed foods my actual
grocery bill has gone up significantly you know especially for the price of a steak uh you know
they're they can't really do any tricks to uh to make steaks seem cheaper they can't really
cut them much smaller uh it's very obvious um they can't really fill them with anything
and so you know the the steaks that I was paying less than $20 for before the pandemic I'm
I'm easily finding myself paying you know over $40 for today and it's uh it's the cost of eating
healthily unfortunately I am actually wondering if you are familiar with the the contrary and
question of Peter Thiel uh not off the top of my head so the idea is that things that very few
people believe to be the case and you believe strongly to be the case because you your unique
experiences made you see the evidence about about a concept about a thing about anything now those
things are the most valuable because that's where you have um that's where you have that's where you
are ahead of the market so my question to you is what is the thing that you strongly believe to be
the case but very few people agree with you on I mean I normally would have said that was around
Bitcoin but that has you know changed a fair amount over the past few years I would say these days
it's mostly privacy uh it's almost nobody understands the value of privacy probably
because they haven't been sufficiently burned by it this is just another thing that I track all of
the time or various data leaks and um if anything the you know amount of information that seems to
be getting leaked and passed around only seems to be increasing over the years and so the question
becomes you know how are people going to react to that and so far it still doesn't seem to be bad
enough that many people are putting effort into improving their privacy or even thinking of it
as like a security issue so obviously I'm uh well both of us are in a fairly unique situation
and how we've been targeted and so I think we understand it um and it's difficult I think to
make other people believe that something like that could ever happen to them yeah privacy doesn't
matter until it does also it's it's not I'm more worried about rather people not valuing highly
their own privacy they are trading it for for all kinds of stuff but uh but what's what's problematic
for me is that privacy development is getting criminalized yeah and like how do you take care
of your privacy when other people are not allowed to build privacy tools in the first place like you
have no options yeah I mean uh part of the problem with privacy is that let's see how does the the
quote go you know it privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of others in society right
privacy has a lot to do with you know interacting with other people and doing so in such a way that
you know those interactions don't get broadcast to the rest of the world but it's kind of reliant
on both parties of the interaction working to maintain that privacy and not leaking that
information to the rest of the world so when you're sharing an information with someone else right
but you can also consider privacy as an ability your ability to selectively reveal yourself to the
world in that case you remove the other party because the other party can do anything they
can try to breach your privacy like this but but you can't see me you can't see me uh I I can I can
I can go into the philosophy of privacy and talk a lot about it but let me ask my final question to
you so since we're both capitalists here I assume yeah what is that what is the value that you're
bringing to the marketplace what is that thing that people can pay money for you yeah I mean at
a high level I provide security services you know this the fundamental point behind bitcoin is you
know getting rid of trusted third parties and unfortunately a lot of people who come into the
space their sort of default journey is they sign up on an exchange they buy some bitcoin and that's
it and so you know that's automatically putting people into a situation where they're dealing
with trusted third parties if this is the default we're just recreating a different version of the
banking system that happens to run on top of a blockchain but you know where a lot of those
interactions are just occurring in you know centralized databases so you know I like to
believe that I am helping to improve the the ethos and you know the general decentralization
of bitcoin ownership which will create just more robustness for the entire network and ecosystem
uh the the sort of flip side worst case situation that I want to avoid is one in which the vast
majority of people who consider themselves bitcoin owners are only owning IOUs in these
centralized databases and if if a significantly large portion of bitcoin ends up falling into
the hands of a few custodians you know there's potential governance issues there there's potential
systemic risk uh you know against governments and nation states coming in uh and basically
using those custodians as choke points uh so you know from that perspective I see it as
adding value to bitcoin overall just by us helping onboard more people into self-custody
and you know it's a it's a convenience issue you know the reason why I think people
don't go into self-custody is because there's a learning curve uh there's responsibility
that you have to take on and people are afraid that they're going to screw up and shoot themselves
in the foot and they're going to lose all their money so you know this is kind of going against
the grain of human civilization in a sense because we've built up civilization our society in general
has scaled via trusted third parties via outsourcing to specialists as you know the ability to
specialize in doing one niche thing makes you much more effective in general and allows us to you
scale up organizations and to continue to progress our technology at an amazing rate but it
introduces fragility into the system and we need to get more people to be willing to take on some
responsibility to be their own bank but I would say that you know CASA's primary goal is to reduce
that learning curve reduce the friction and the level of anxiety that comes with self-custody
because we basically help people avoid a lot of the foot guns a lot of the ways that you can
screw up just due to ignorance and naivete and you know getting more people into a sort of
assisted self-custody situation I think is going to be good for the entire ecosystem

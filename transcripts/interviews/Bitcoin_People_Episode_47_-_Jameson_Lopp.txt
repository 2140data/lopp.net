[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   I think it was a Monday morning and in those days I would get up at like 5 or 5.30 in the morning and go to the gym.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.520]   And I had done that and when I got to the gym for whatever reason I tweeted out something funny about,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.480]   "Oh, it's another Monday and we've still got, you know, block size wars in front of us for the whole week."
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.400]   And apparently, you know, the attacker saw that and made the assumption that I had just rolled out of bed
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.920]   and so, you know, I was going to be at home for the next hour or so.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.360]   And so they decided, you know, like 7 a.m. was the perfect time to strike.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:52.240]   And so I was coming home from the gym and I run into a roadblock, you know, stop and talk to the cop
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.160]   and they're like, "Oh, we have a potential active shooter incident."
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.440]   And so I, of course, got pretty concerned.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:10.320]   It wasn't until, I don't know, took like another 20 or 30 minutes or so before we realized that, you know,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.080]   they were actually looking for me.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.840]   They were, you know, at my address.

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:16.560]   I am so honored to have with me today Jamison Mupp, who is co-founder and CTO of CASA
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.720]   and professional cypherpunk. Welcome to Bitcoin people, Jamison.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.120]   Glad to be here and to meet another Bitcoin person.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:35.040]   It's lovely of you to be here. You are enormously patient. You've been in the space since 2012,
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.840]   so that's over 10 years now, and you continue to give your time to new folk in the space,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.440]   and you are insanely patient and kind in coming on board here today, and I really appreciate it.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.320]   What I would love to do, Jamison, is to go back a little bit in time, go back in history to you as a
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.840]   child. I want you to take us briefly through some of your career history,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:16.160]   and then we're going to get into your Bitcoin life. You were always an insanely smart human being.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.800]   You were reading well above your year level at school. What was that like for you? I would
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:33.840]   love to just get a sense of what you were like as a kid and how those years shaped you as a person.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.680]   What was your experience of that?
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.880]   >> Sure. I mean, the short version of how I would describe it is I was the sort of stereotypical
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:52.320]   outcast nerd. I was an only child. My parents were very focused on my academic learning.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.720]   You could call it very supportive, or you could also say they were very insistent that academics
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:12.800]   come before everything else. Oddly, though, they were anti-computer. They saw computers just as
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:22.000]   video game machines. I begged for a computer, I think, basically as soon as I learned what one
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.520]   even was. My friends had them because I had friends whose parents were actually software
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.960]   engineers. But I did not get a computer until I was in middle school. Once I did, I was just
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.360]   off to the races, really ingesting as much information as possible, like teaching myself
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.840]   how to create websites. Then I ended up taking college-level computer science class, I think,
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:00.080]   when I was a freshman in high school or something. My interest in computers and computer science just
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:11.360]   grew from there. I guess you could say I was always pretty intellectual because I probably
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.080]   spent more time with books than with humans for a lot of my early childhood, at least when I was
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:27.440]   outside of school. I was literally getting wagons of books from the library. I had a special
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:37.200]   exemption to go over their maximum number of checked out books. That helped my education,
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:45.040]   but it also harmed, I think, my social side of things because it just made me
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.520]   weirder and nerdier and more outcast because I would make references to things and use words
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.040]   that my peer group didn't know. They basically thought that in many cases I was speaking a
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.520]   foreign language. >> Yeah. I find it interesting that,
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:13.200]   and we can get into all of this stuff as the conversation unravels, but you had that experience
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.320]   as a child. You've been subject to a swatting attack that we will discuss a little bit more
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.360]   in detail as we get there in the timeline of your life. You get a bit of pushback from the community
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.560]   about your stance on Ethereum and certain alts and where you stand on layer twos and
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:43.920]   up-and-coming technologies in the Altcoin space. You have every right to be incredibly wary around
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:54.000]   people, and yet you continue to show up to new programs like this to be a really involved member
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.200]   of the community. You handle people and you handle pushback and criticism with enormous grace and
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:13.120]   calm. Where does that come from? >> Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of it really was due to getting
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:21.360]   interested in stoicism when I was in middle school. That certainly shaped a lot of my views on life,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:30.240]   and it did give me, I think, a sense of calmness and a reliance upon rational thinking,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:42.560]   critical thinking, logical discourse. That, along with the fact that I was bullied a lot as a child,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:49.120]   had to deal with people basically using their emotions rather than their logic on me and seeing
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:57.280]   sort of negative consequences of that, that certainly molded my perspective. It gave me
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:04.640]   also a strong sense of justice. That ties into some of the stuff that happened after my swatting
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.440]   of seeking out justice on my own and also just my interest in the space in general.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.280]   One of the several reasons why I initially got interested in Bitcoin and then started going down
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:26.800]   the rabbit hole and learning about the cypherpunks, it really was the promise of being able to empower
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:35.520]   individuals more against oppression. That's what really, I would say, gave my life a sense of
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:43.600]   purpose. I always liked computers and I spent the first decade of my career solving interesting
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:51.840]   problems, but I never had a real commitment to the industry I was working in. Once I started
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:59.600]   going down these rabbit holes, I really decided not so much that I wanted to commit myself to
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.640]   Bitcoin, but I wanted to commit myself to using my skills as a technologist to empower people,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.200]   to build tooling, to disseminate knowledge and information of how to use these tools that have
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.760]   been created so that they can leverage really an immense amount of power for themselves.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.840]   This has always been the promise of cryptography and then the promise of Bitcoin is that you can
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.760]   empower yourself. But that promise, it's been out of reach for a lot of people for a variety
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.280]   of different reasons. This is really what I've been doing full-time for the past eight years,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:45.520]   is trying to make it easier for people to attain the level of defensibility and sovereignty that
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:52.400]   I've been able to do since I joined the Bitcoin community. So let's go down that track. Let's
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.920]   talk about what happened to you when you first came across the white paper. And I'm going to
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.640]   quote here from Cointelegraph. There's an article or an interview that was done with you. Bear with
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:09.760]   me. I'm going to quote a few sentences here, about three sentences. "I was just blown away," he says.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.040]   This is you, you say, noting that Satoshi approached the double spending and Byzantine
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.240]   generals problem from the exact opposite direction of the performance and efficiency mindset
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.960]   Lopp had been taught. "When I read the white paper and I saw the solution to the problem,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.280]   I was amazed because it was both elegant and ass-backward," he says. "The solution was to
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.480]   make everything really, really expensive in terms of resource usage. I was like, wow,
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.520]   I never in a million years would have thought to try that because it just goes against our nature
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:49.120]   as computer scientists." So I've heard this before, but I suppose when I read that, I got...
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:58.080]   It helped me get inside the mind of a computer scientist, seeing this thing from the first time
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:05.600]   and lighting up with the kind of excitement of coming across something so new. So take me through
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.920]   that experience, if you wouldn't mind. What happened for you when you first read that white
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.880]   paper? And then I want to broaden out into the context of 2012. So let's just talk about your
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.400]   white paper experience first. >> Yeah, so I'll never remember
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:33.040]   for certain, but I'm pretty sure that I read the white paper as a result of a Slashdot post.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.400]   And Slashdot is just a news site for nerds. It was a lot bigger back in the day. This was before
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:47.360]   places like Reddit and Y Combinator existed. And so I had read a number of different technical
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:54.000]   white papers over the years. And usually I found them incredibly dense and boring and with a lot
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.120]   of mathematical equations that I didn't even care to try to dig into. And the Bitcoin white paper
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:07.280]   was different for several reasons. But the first was it was just so approachable. It was only like
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:14.640]   eight or nine pages. It was written in fairly plain English. It did not have much technical
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.160]   jargon. It did a good job of explaining the new terms that were in the white paper.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:28.080]   And then when it was explaining what the problem was, I actually found it quite fascinating because
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.680]   I had never thought about the problem before. I'd never, like most people, never even really
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   thought about money, how does money work? You generally just use it as it's presented to you.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.400]   And as long as it meets your needs, you don't really question what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:55.840]   So we got through this white paper and I started mulling over it. I thought it seemed like it
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.840]   made sense. It seemed like it could work. I wasn't convinced that, oh my goodness, this is
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:09.680]   the absolute savior for all the world's monetary problems, but I didn't see any major holes in it
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.720]   right off. And I already knew at the time it had been running for several years. And this was part
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   of the reason why I read the white paper is because it wasn't the first time I'd heard about
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.720]   Bitcoin. I had definitely heard about it a few times over the past couple of years. And I had
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:31.120]   always just assumed, oh, this is another nerd game that a bunch of people are going to put their
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:37.840]   money into and lose everything. It's going to end horribly. So the fact that it continued existing
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.920]   on the internet, which is very adversarial environment, it made me realize I wanted to
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:52.640]   understand it better and that it could be an interesting long-term project. And so the only
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.840]   way to really learn more about Bitcoin is to actually start using it. So I immediately went
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.560]   out and I performed my first ever wire transfer. It was actually an international wire transfer to
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:12.560]   this little bank in Tokyo. And it took like a week for it to go through. I had to spend several hours
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:23.280]   at the bank filling out paperwork, had to get lectured by them several times, basically to make
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.160]   them confident that I wasn't getting scammed and that I understood that once the money left the
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.760]   bank account, that there was pretty much no way to get it back. And that was also an interesting
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:40.800]   experience because I didn't know it at the time, but that experience was about to really give me
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:48.960]   a ruler, a sort of gauge of how difficult it was to send money internationally, because I had never
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.680]   even tried to do that before via the traditional system versus of course, Bitcoin. Once I eventually
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:04.560]   got that account set up at MT Gox and got my first Bitcoins purchased and thankfully withdrawn,
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:15.920]   a lot of people say that Gox caught them by surprise or whatever if they were around back
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:22.400]   in the day. But the collapse of that exchange was not a surprise at all to me because I was
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:30.480]   a web developer. I had been building internet applications for a number of years and I saw how
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.200]   poorly written and executed their web application was. So I did not trust them for a moment to hold
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.160]   on to my money for me. Thankfully, unfortunately, a lot of people, I guess, were not quite so savvy.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:52.160]   So that was just the beginning. And for the first year or so, I was just subscribing to the Bitcoin
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.720]   subreddit and Bitcoin talk and really the small number of places where people were actually
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.680]   talking about this thing, because it was not really talked about on Twitter or other mainstream
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:11.120]   social media. And about a year later, I decided, okay, I want to get more technical. And that's
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:19.040]   when I launched a side project where I basically forked Bitcoin core and I added in a bunch of
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:25.360]   instrumentation and metrics collection. What I was really doing is the same stuff that I
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:32.240]   had been doing for the past several years at my full-time job, sort of a DevOps type of
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:39.520]   infrastructure monitoring, trying to bring things to the surface so that you could understand what
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:45.680]   was going on, on your machines as they were running. And I felt like this was a good way
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:51.040]   to contribute to Bitcoin because Bitcoin is all about transparency and openness. And I felt like
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.800]   when you were running an actual Bitcoin node, you weren't really sure what it was doing and
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.080]   there was room for better understanding and improvement. And so that was a nice
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.560]   initial project that it got referenced by a number of developers over the years.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.880]   So I felt like that was a success. And then about a year after that was when enough venture capital
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.560]   started flowing into the system, enough jobs started getting posted. I realized this was a
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.840]   good opportunity for me to make a switch because I was already spending so much of my time thinking
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.560]   about Bitcoin stuff, I might as well just get paid to do it. (laughs)
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:37.520]   Indeed. And we're all the more grateful for it. So that's what was going on for you personally.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:43.200]   Contextually around you, a lot was going on in the Bitcoin space. At the time that you got in,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:52.160]   there was... So you're talking about Mt. Gox. You're at the tail end of the WikiLeaks
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.280]   transitioning or taking Bitcoin payments, so moving from PayPal to Bitcoin.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:08.320]   You've got the first halving in 2012. So there's a range of... Oh, and Silk Road is still going.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:18.640]   And Ross Albrecht and kind of all of that space. How involved were you with any of that? How
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:26.320]   familiar were you with the community involved in all of that? What was it like to be involved
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:32.880]   in all of those elements of what I'm going to call milestone events in Bitcoin's history
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:40.400]   at the personal level? How exposed were you to any of that? And what was the kind of
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.000]   talk amongst the community online? Yeah, well, I mean, you have to understand
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.920]   that the earliest wave of adopters back then were ideologues. We were the libertarians.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:01.600]   We were the crypto anarchists. We were the nerdy computer scientists who might also be libertarians,
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.720]   crypto anarchists, and whatever. I kind of came in with a blend of several different
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:13.840]   perspectives that made me interested in this as a project. And it was a really niche community.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:21.600]   So a lot of the stuff that was being talked about were the small number of projects that existed
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.400]   there. There was not a very diverse number of things that you could do with Bitcoin back then.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:35.120]   I mean, it was considered cool when you could pay this guy in Bitcoin to send you baklava or
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:41.360]   alpaca socks. Those were novelties that anybody would even accept it in return for anything else.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:51.360]   And it was those first early purchases of being able to actually receive a physical good in return
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:58.880]   for Bitcoin that also, it clicked again where I realized, okay, this is a real thing. There are
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:06.240]   people out there who agree with me that it has value and we can engage in economic interactions.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.880]   And the only real question at the time was, okay, how far can we take this? And so of course,
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:22.320]   Silk Road was the extreme example. And I puttered around on Silk Road. I wanted to understand it as
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:30.080]   well. Never actually interacted with it or made any orders. And the main reason for that was I
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.880]   was just too paranoid. - Didn't buy your drugs on that?
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:42.480]   - I was too paranoid because I could never convince myself that the last mile problem of
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:49.360]   actually having the physical delivery of the goods sent to my house, I was never convinced that that
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:56.080]   was safe enough. So I didn't want to get busted with drugs showing up on my doorstep. I suppose
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.480]   there's plausible deniability and whatnot, but I don't know. It always seemed too risky to me.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:09.680]   And of course, there was the issue of the privacy of the actual Bitcoin that you were using. Now,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.520]   Silk Road had a mixer. And so I think that that gave some people more
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:24.480]   conviction that it was safe and private, but really our understanding of Bitcoin privacy
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.200]   a decade ago was not that great. And we've learned over the years that you have to be
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.720]   really, really careful if you're doing anything that is creating an immutable public record for
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.520]   all time. -
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:47.600]   Yes, indeed. And it's interesting that you were already so aware of privacy and yet
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:54.960]   even someone like you still got caught out later down the track. Let me just, before we get there,
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:03.040]   talk about the block size wars because on a timeline, they came next. They came around 2015,
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.280]   I'm going to say, 2016. -
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.880]   Yeah, I mean, it was a slow burn up, right? I mean, people had been talking about scalability
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:18.240]   probably since, well, really it was since the original announcement thread that Satoshi sent,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.840]   people were saying it would never scale. And so there was always a sort of background rumbling
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:31.680]   of people talking about scaling. There were a few times early on, I think in the like 2013,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:44.000]   2014 era where Bitcoin initially had no block size limit. I think in late 2009 or early 2010,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.080]   Satoshi set that one megabyte block size limit. And this was never a problem until around 2013
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:58.240]   or so. And I think it was Satoshi Dice, which was run by Eric Voorhees that generated so much
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.720]   demand that we didn't hit that one megabyte block size limit. But what happened was back then we had
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:11.360]   these soft block size limits that were set by the miners. I think it was initially 250 kilobytes.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.680]   And then we hit that. And I think a bunch of the miners upped it to 500. And then we hit that and
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:22.400]   they upped it to 750. And then eventually we hit the hard cap within a few years. And once the hard
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:30.960]   cap started getting hit and there was nowhere else to go, that's when the debate with the block size
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:40.880]   and all of the scaling proposals really went full force. >> Did it get nasty or were people
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.520]   reasonably civil about it? And what was your experience of that? And where did you, I think
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.560]   you changed your mind at some point, didn't you? >> Correct.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.760]   >> Yeah. Tell me about that. And tell me about not only the changing of your mind,
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.680]   but how people perceive that amongst the community, the fact that you would change your mind on that.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:11.600]   >> Yeah. So I think one important bit of context is that when I first went full time into Bitcoin,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:22.000]   my job at BitGo was to run infrastructure basically that was in charge of indexing
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.640]   the blockchain and all of its data and was responsible for managing our transaction sending
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:39.840]   queue. Now, as a result of this, our early indexers were all built on top of BitcoinJ,
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.040]   which was one of the very early Bitcoin client implementations written in Java.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:52.480]   And it was, I believe, initially started by Mike Kern. And I think Matt Corallo was also involved.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:59.200]   But at the time, Mike Kern was really the primary maintainer of BitcoinJ. So I interacted with Mike
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:11.040]   Kern a fair amount whenever I came across issues with using BitcoinJ. And he and I had very similar
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:17.760]   approaches and perspectives to Bitcoin. And this was because we both had similar jobs,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.440]   at least before we got into Bitcoin. So he was working at Google, doing very large scale
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:35.520]   computing. And I had been working at an email marketing service where I was running infrastructure
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:46.640]   and was responsible for basically running jobs that were... They were tasked with running across
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:57.200]   these hundreds of server clusters of hundreds of petabytes of raw analytics data that got generated
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.800]   as a result of the hundred million emails that got sent out through our system every day and all of
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:10.720]   the clicks and opens and other tracking metrics that came back. So point being, we had this DevOps
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:20.640]   mindset and really there's a capacity planning aspect to DevOps when you're running infrastructure
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:31.120]   for large scale applications. And that basically falls along the lines of, you can't just run at
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:39.360]   90% or 100% capacity, even though that might be more efficient, cost efficient for you as an
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:48.160]   organization, because there tend to be spikes in demand. Demand is very rarely this constant thing.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:58.000]   And this is true for basically anything. For example, just from the fact that we have waking
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.080]   and sleeping cycles, you often see daily and nightly demand that goes along basically as the
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:10.240]   sun is crossing over different populated areas of the earth or weekly cycles because people are at
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:21.680]   work or people are at home or out and about. So we had issues at my company because we were a
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:32.160]   marketing company where we would have to have excess capacity, really anywhere from three to
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:42.320]   five X of what our normal demand was. And this was because on certain days, the internet retail
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:50.080]   industry, they create a lot of sales. So be that like your Black Friday or Cyber Monday,
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.960]   the time is basically coming up to Christmas or other major holidays.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:04.400]   And if you don't have that excess capacity available, what happens? Well, people hit these
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:11.520]   hard limits, things start to fail, your customers get pissed off, your customers may leave for a
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.640]   different service that has better capacity planning. And so this was really the perspective
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:23.760]   that he and I and a number of other engineers in the space had, which is that it's not good for us
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.000]   to be hitting this hard cap because that means people's transactions aren't going through,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.360]   they're getting a bad user experience, they're going to seek out alternatives, and that is going
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:39.840]   to result in constrained demand for Bitcoin and thus probably a lower value for Bitcoin because
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:49.600]   it can't meet all of the demand. And it took me a while, but it was actually a direct result of me
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:57.440]   running this infrastructure and seeing how difficult it was to scale with larger and larger
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:06.720]   blockchains that helped me understand that that was not the highest priority for the system as a
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:14.640]   whole. That there were plenty of alternatives out there for people to make cheap transactions on.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:22.000]   And really, even back then, there were already thousands of altcoins. It was very easy for
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.800]   someone to spool up an altcoin network and it would be really cheap to transact because
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.600]   there was no demand for those resources.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:38.480]   So what was the atmosphere at the time? What was the...
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:50.720]   The same way that you're talking about capacity and spikes, there's been spikes in the
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:57.920]   culture of Bitcoin, I'm going to say, over the years. There's times where it's more acrimonious
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:04.960]   and there's times where it's more peaceful. And you've weathered a lot of that along the way.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.360]   Just tell me about for what it's worth, and it may not, I mean, maybe there's not all that much
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.600]   to it, but what was your experience of that like online? What was the backlash you got at the time?
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.560]   What were... Yeah.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:29.120]   Yeah. So I was an early proponent of Bitcoin XT, which was a proposed hard fork, I think,
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:38.480]   basically to eight megabyte blocks, which eight times larger. And I ran a Bitcoin XT node for a
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:47.680]   while. I was a moderator of the Bitcoin XT subreddit for a while. And when talking to the
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.240]   people who voluntarily joined that community, it was fine, of course, because we all had similar
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:59.200]   perspectives, but wider on Bitcoin Twitter or actually even on the networks themselves,
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.920]   it was certainly adversarial. The best example that I can give actually is that at one point,
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:16.960]   my entire home internet connection got knocked offline for over a day. And this was basically,
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:27.360]   I think it was deemed to be a DNS reflection attack. But suffice to say that someone or some
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   ones who did not like the idea of the Bitcoin XT and hard forking, they basically did a denial
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:41.520]   of service attack on all of the Bitcoin XT nodes that they could find running on the network.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:49.520]   And it just happened to be a type of attack that my ISP literally, they had no defense for. My ISP
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.480]   literally just shut off my account and said, "We'll let you back on the internet when the attack
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:04.880]   stops." So I think that was a good example. There have been similar attacks in the next few years
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:12.320]   as other alternative Bitcoin fork implementations came up and certain engineers would basically
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:18.560]   look into their code and sometimes they would find an exploit and actually be able to send a
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.680]   command to these nodes that caused them to crash. And you would see these massive spikes and
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.640]   declines and node counts on the network going up and down as people were trying to figure out how
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   to fix these nodes and then exploit them again. So this is why I say Bitcoin is an adversarial
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:45.360]   environment. The internet in general is adversarial because you're literally putting a window or a
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.320]   door right here that billions of people can knock on and try to get through.

[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.920]   kill you makes you stronger because of course you find out where those weak points are.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.360]   So from those kinds of attacks, you then experienced a very personal attack,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:56.480]   2017. Can you talk us through what happened with that? With the swatting,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:06.640]   invasion, I don't know quite what we call it. And what do we know about the motives of the guy?
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:12.560]   I know you tracked him down eventually, you found out who it was. Do you know anything about
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.440]   his motives and why he went down that track? So if you could talk us through the experience
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:26.480]   and the unraveling of finding him. So the process, which was no easy process
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:32.240]   of then tracking him down and then what you found out about him when you did finally meet him.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:41.840]   Yeah. So, you know, despite me having a decent understanding of privacy leaks,
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:48.240]   mainly because my job for so many years had been to sift through all the data that gets collected.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:55.600]   I had never really taken a particularly strong stance protecting my privacy, you know, other
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.400]   than running things like ad blockers to try to stop a lot of those metrics and, you know, getting
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:07.520]   myself off of all the email lists. But I didn't go to many extremes of like running VPNs or
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.200]   much harder things that are around, you know, protecting your physical location privacy.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:24.240]   So what happened? Well, 2017 was really when all the scaling stuff was coming to a head. We had
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:30.720]   a number of different proposals and sort of threats on the table to fork Bitcoin network.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:39.840]   And at some point, I'll never know specifically what it was, but basically I said something
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:46.160]   that, you know, triggered some people who must've been more on the large block supporter side.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:57.120]   And they, if we are to believe, you know, what I was told, they basically went to their friend
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   who had a history of swatting people and said, Hey, you should swat this guy and screw with him
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:09.680]   because, you know, we don't like him. And so according to him, he didn't even know who I was.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:18.000]   He wasn't into the whole scaling debate stuff. He was just, you know, a punk teenager who
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   did this stuff for fun and possibly for profit. I do have plenty of reasons from my research to
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.280]   suspect that he made a decent amount of money basically extorting people. And then that was
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:40.000]   what he attempted to do with me though. I did not send him any money and instead I put a bounty on
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.760]   his head, which, you know, ended up helping me, but it took, no, it took like three or four years
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:54.400]   of investigation and a number of sort of lucky breaks to be able to track the guy down. It was
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:03.280]   not easy by any means, especially really what I learned is that law enforcement doesn't really
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:12.720]   care about your problems. If you're not in imminent danger it's really hard to prosecute,
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:24.640]   you know, sort of white collar crimes. It's also very difficult to find attorneys that will act
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:32.320]   proactively on your behalf. Basically what I found out is like the vast majority of
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:41.200]   attorneys out there, if they're on the criminal side, they're either for defending people who are
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:52.640]   being prosecuted by the state or they are there to, if they're on the aggressive side, usually
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:59.200]   they are working for the state. So it's very hard to find like private attorneys that are
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:05.520]   prosecutorial. And I was just lucky that I found one who was like a former state prosecutor who
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:11.200]   now had a private practice. And so they had some connections with private investigators and FBI
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:18.320]   and stuff, but it was also, it was just really hard to get the FBI's attention. Certainly don't
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:24.800]   bother calling any of their main phone numbers because that won't get you anywhere. But yeah,
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:31.840]   number of lucky breaks later and we end up, you know, I don't know, I forgot about it for like a
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:40.160]   year or two. And then I finally got a contact in the cyber crime division with the FBI, handed all
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.520]   of my findings over to them, didn't hear from them for like another year, thought, you know,
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.840]   that was it, nothing was going to happen. And then just randomly out of the blue, one day I got a
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:39:01.280]   call from my attorney that says, well, they found him. And the, what was it? The federal district
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:08.720]   attorney declined to prosecute because they're a minor. So apparently in America, there is no
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:16.160]   like juvenile justice system at the federal level. So like the prosecutor, apparently it doesn't,
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:24.240]   they can't really do much or it's not worth their time. Thankfully, few more weeks went by and the
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.360]   state level district attorney said that they were interested in prosecuting. And then I went through
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.960]   the whole rigmarole of, you know, flying there and testifying in court and so on and so forth.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.520]   But, you know, the kid, he had no record and he had never been caught for anything before. And if
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:47.440]   it wasn't for me, he probably wouldn't have been caught for a while. So he basically got a slap on
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:55.280]   the wrist and, you know, was told he needed to clean up his act. So hopefully he did. I'll
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:03.360]   probably never hear from him again, but I don't hold too much animosity for him because, you know,
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.880]   he was just a naive young kid. I don't think he fully understood the potential ramifications of
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.320]   what he was doing. No, that's right. And it's really more about the people who set him up for
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:20.080]   it. It occurs to me we haven't actually described here and some people may not know what a swatting
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.640]   attack actually is and what that looked like. And my understanding is that you weren't actually at
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:33.280]   home at the time. I'm not sure if anybody was. I guess I'm curious about the, you know,
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:40.240]   the emotions you went through at the time as you saw what was going on, your road was blocked off,
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:47.280]   you didn't even know it was your house. So if you could kind of describe a little bit about the scene,
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:54.480]   what actually physically happened and what was your, you've talked about your stoicism
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:00.640]   and how much that's helped you, but I would imagine there's an element of PTSD after an
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:05.680]   event like that. So I'm wondering what the emotional fallout was for you. So if you wouldn't
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.160]   mind kind of describing the process, but then those kind of immediate days or weeks afterwards
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:15.600]   and what went on for you, because you resolved very quickly to go after this guy. And I think
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:25.440]   you got quite sort of used that energy in a sort of focused, angry way to, you know, to regroup.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.200]   But that takes some doing to get to that place, I would imagine. So can you take us through that?
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:41.280]   Yeah, you know, when it actually happened, it was surreal. It was also a lucky break in that I had,
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:48.320]   I think it was a Monday morning. And in those days, I would get up at like five or 530 in the
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:56.720]   morning and go to the gym. And I had done that. And when I got to the gym, for whatever reason,
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.120]   I tweeted out something funny about, oh, it's another Monday and we've still got, you know,
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:10.640]   block size wars in front of us for the whole week. And apparently, you know, the attacker saw that
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.960]   and made the assumption that I had just rolled out of bed. And so, you know, I was going to be at
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:22.240]   home for the next hour or so. And so they decided, you know, like 7am was the perfect time to strike.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:33.040]   And so I was coming home from the gym and I run into a roadblock, you know, stop and talk to the
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.720]   cop and they're like, oh, we have a potential active shooter incident. And so I, of course,
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:47.520]   got pretty concerned. It wasn't until, I don't know, took like another 20 or 30 minutes or so
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.840]   before we realized that, you know, they were actually looking for me. They were, you know,
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:04.480]   at my address. And I immediately knew what it was like. I knew what swatting was. In fact, like
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:11.120]   one of the early Bitcoin developers was swatted in 2014. So it wasn't even the first time that a
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.640]   Bitcoin person had been swatted. Swatting was more something that was happening in the gaming
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:24.080]   community. But basically it's, you know, you find your targets, you find out where they live
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:33.520]   and you call their local police department and you use the right words to, you know, create a
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:43.040]   highly escalated situation. So in my case, he said, I think he said I had killed somebody and
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:50.640]   I had hostages and I had bombs and I was demanding like $50,000 or something. But basically, you know,
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:57.840]   just go down the list, you know, just tick all the boxes. You know, this is a highly dangerous,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.760]   mentally unstable person who is barricaded in with hostages. So we have to send our highest
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:09.120]   level of threat response, which is the SWAT team and shut down their entire neighborhood
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:16.720]   with hundreds of houses. So, you know, I knew what that was. And in fact, like when I
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:23.280]   jumped up into their mobile command unit, I was like, sorry for the trouble, everybody. You know,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.160]   the first thing they asked me was, do you have any enemies? And I was like, oh yeah,
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.840]   oh yeah. I have a pretty good idea of like why you're all here.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:38.720]   Yeah. Okay. So you've weathered more than your fair share of storms and I know that you've
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:45.920]   reorganized your life to increase the level of privacy at a, particularly at a personal level.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:56.960]   You're now, since CASA, well, you're still, it seems to be a constant in your life perhaps,
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:03.120]   I was going to say. It seems to be back with pushback that you get around altcoins,
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:11.200]   your stance on ordinals, your stance on layer two experimentation and technologies.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:17.840]   So there seems to be this kind of constant pushback and maybe that's what it needs to be.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:23.600]   I mean, you've said the internet and Bitcoin is naturally adversarial and maybe that's what
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:30.880]   it needs to be in order to consistently test itself and be pushing back against ideas and
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:36.000]   always questioning and always testing, but that's got to be tiresome from your end.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:45.680]   Yeah. I mean, it requires a certain level of commitment, right? So a lot of the people who
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:53.200]   were around and were more prominent back then aren't so prominent anymore. In many cases,
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:03.680]   they just got tired of dealing with the constant battles as it were. I believe that this is one of,
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:13.040]   if not the most important thing that I can be working on right now. And if I really want to,
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:21.120]   I can always take a break, but I don't know. It's also kind of an addiction. It is,
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:32.480]   I believe, a battle of ideas. And so I don't know if you've been paying attention to some of the
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:38.880]   most recent drama, but in many cases, like even in the past couple of weeks with the recent drama,
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.120]   I haven't even been making arguments for or against the specific proposal that people are
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:51.600]   talking about. Rather, most of the time when I'm commenting, it's more meta commentary of like,
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:57.920]   you know, this is a logical way to approach debate or, you know, this is an irrational,
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.840]   emotional way of approaching debate. And so, you know, I'm thinking of it more of,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:10.080]   I guess you could call it thought leader because I'm really, I'm like, I'm talking about how we
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.200]   should be thinking about things rather than necessarily prescribing that we go one way
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:22.960]   or another. - Oh, how fascinating. So you've really become expert over time at how to manage
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:32.640]   these things and now able to teach that on the basis of your experience, which is really a kind
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:39.360]   of stunning outcome from the process and a positive and a productive outcome from the process. Again,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:48.240]   it's kind of channeling many negative experiences into a really positive outcome for Bitcoin,
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:54.720]   for the community, for yourself, for the people around you. - I mean, it's also been an interesting
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:01.840]   journey because my social media profile grew so much. It is a very different experience
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:10.720]   being on a social network and having a hundred followers versus 10,000 followers versus 100,000
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:20.800]   followers. I noticed, you know, marked differences in the reactions that you would get and just sort
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:30.240]   of the volume of responses and of course, edge cases. And so one thing that I've said many times,
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:37.760]   especially about the swatting incident is that it's not a new thing. You know,
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:47.280]   celebrities have always had stalkers, for example, but pre-internet that was limited to a
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:56.240]   mega celebrity problem, you know? And this is basically an issue of attention. So thanks to
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   the internet, you can very easily go from being a nobody who no one is paying attention to,
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:12.720]   to, you know, if you're fortunate/unfortunate enough to go viral, you can have either the
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:20.160]   praise or the wrath, or probably some of both of millions of people directed at you overnight.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:29.920]   And it's really, it's the fact that your life can change so suddenly as a result of
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:38.160]   the attention that, you know, this is what catches people unaware. And it's one of the
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:47.120]   reasons why I think privacy is so important and it's hard to overstate. The average person
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:53.280]   will probably go most of their life, you know, never having to deal with this type of problem,
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:50:00.400]   but you can almost think of it as being a loser of the social media lottery, if you will.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:11.440]   If you do or say something that triggers people in the right way, then you may find that due to
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:17.200]   the law of large numbers, and I still am optimistic, I believe the vast majority of people
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:23.280]   are good moral people who don't want to hurt others, but there is some small, you know,
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:30.400]   single digit, maybe even less percentage of people out there who they don't abide by the same
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:37.440]   ethics. They don't have problems, you know, attacking others in order to try to achieve
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:43.840]   some end. And so, you know, that's the real reason why I got swatted is because I had so
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.960]   much attention and, you know, I triggered enough people that eventually one of them who had the
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:55.440]   skill set to pull off the swatting and had the right mental frame of mind to want to actually do
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:01.360]   it, you know, that's what happened. And because I didn't have the right defenses in place,
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:09.040]   they were able to pull that off. Now, you know, years and tens of thousands of dollars and many
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:16.400]   lifestyle changes later, I am confident that that type of person can't pull that off against me
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:26.320]   again, but it really is a high bar to cross over. >> Yeah, indeed, indeed. I want to move towards
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.000]   something a bit more optimistic and I want to come back to kind of Bitcoin and what it means
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.960]   for the world and your original reasons for getting into Bitcoin, being driven by that
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:46.320]   sense of justice that you were. So this is a two-part question. In 2012 or 2015, could you
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:54.240]   have imagined Bitcoin being where it is today in terms of global adoption and politicians talking
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:52:01.840]   about their policies like for Bitcoin in the 2024 election? So could you have imagined that?
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:09.760]   And second part, therefore, predicting forward, what do you imagine another 10 years from that?
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:19.600]   >> Yeah, I mean, I think that the pace has caught most of the early adopters by surprise. I mean,
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:31.200]   we sometimes had these discussions of where might this thing go over the long term, but I generally
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:37.920]   had more of a generational take on it. I was like, you know, maybe 30, 20, 30 years from now,
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:46.960]   it'll be pretty big. Also, that's kind of the lifespan of the average fiat currency is like 20,
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:53.680]   25 years. So I'm like, if Bitcoin can survive past that, then it's really proven itself to be
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:09.040]   better than fiat and at least that way. So it's hard to imagine because humans experience time
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:18.000]   and experience things linearly. Our brains extrapolate things linearly. So it's very
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:28.320]   difficult for us to predict a rate of change that is actually exponential. So yeah, it's hard for me
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:33.600]   to even imagine. I try not to get my heads in the clouds too much because I've seen some people who
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.560]   try to put on their exponential thinking cap and then they can take it too far and they're like,
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:45.360]   "Oh, we're all going to be millionaires next year," type of thing. So I try to stay more
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:53.520]   focused on the short term and what I can do to keep pushing forward. And the sort of hope is that
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:54:00.560]   if there are enough other people out there like myself who are contributing, whatever skills they
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.400]   have, you don't have to be technical to be contributing to this space. Look at yourself.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:10.640]   I don't know if you consider yourself like a historian or a sociologist or whatever,
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:17.600]   but we're all contributing in our own way, trying to improve the system, trying to help others
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:24.720]   understand what it is. And if you're helping other people understand it, then perhaps that will have
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:31.920]   a domino effect of getting some of those people to contribute their own skills. And this is how
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:37.760]   you get the network to grow, not just linearly, but also exponentially. It's almost like a reverse
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.600]   Ponzi scheme, right? It's like you get two people and they get two people and they get two people,
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:49.440]   and everything to the power of two. That's how things really start to go crazy. And that's one
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:56.160]   of the reasons why Bitcoin has these crazy up and down market cycles. And I think that that is going
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:01.680]   to continue for the foreseeable future. - I don't normally ask this question,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:06.400]   of people, but you've been through three Hardings. So I have to ask you,
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:16.560]   I need to ask for a price prediction for maybe 10 years from now, let's say 2033.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:22.960]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't do price predictions because
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:35.520]   we don't know what's going to happen to fiat, right? My only conviction, it's not that Bitcoin
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.000]   is going to keep going up in price. My only conviction is that the value of fiat is going
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.920]   to keep going down in price. So even if I said, Bitcoin is going to be worth a million dollars
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:54.960]   10 years from now, that actually doesn't mean very much because it's possible that a million dollars
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:59.840]   isn't worth the same as it is today. And not only possible, it's basically guaranteed.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:06.720]   - Yeah, absolutely. And it's the right way to look at it. That makes a great deal of sense
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:12.560]   and it ties into what, well, I'm just going to say Greg Foss, but many folk in the Bitcoin community,
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:17.440]   we know that fiat, if nothing else, is trending towards zero. So,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:26.960]   it doesn't leave much choice. It doesn't leave much choice in terms of the average person looking
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:34.480]   around for investment options and living their life in some sort of reasonable manner.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:41.520]   Jameson, where to next for your personal journey?
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:48.160]   What are you working on and what do you want to be working on? So you're saying you don't have
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.840]   a specific vision necessarily for Bitcoin world as it were, but what's your particular vision
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.240]   for yourself? -
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:10.960]   Well, I mean, a lot of my time is just focused on my company and I'm not a business savvy person.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:17.520]   Thankfully, I'm not CEO. I would be a terrible CEO having to deal with all of those different
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.120]   moving parts and especially deal with the sort of human relationships side of things.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:36.320]   But my goal is to continue surveying the landscape of what is available from a technology perspective
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:46.000]   and figuring out if there's room for me to make it easier for people to use some of the tooling
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:53.600]   that still holds great power and holds great potential. And so, in terms of what Casa does
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:58:06.320]   or what I want to do, I kind of see Casa as an extension of a consulting service. I have people
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:11.840]   come to me all the time who want me to do consulting for them, but I'm like, "This is what
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:20.400]   Casa is for. It's security consulting. I do brain dumps on our employees. They learn from our
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:29.360]   clients and teach me about what people are having problems with." We are all together trying to
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:38.800]   navigate the very dangerous and complex world of being your own bank. And we're trying to make it
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:44.960]   easier and allow people to be more confident that they can do it because I see this as a...
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:52.480]   It can become an existential crisis if we don't constantly fight the battle
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:59:00.640]   because really what the battle is, it's a battle of sovereignty versus convenience.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:07.920]   And the unfortunate thing and the reason why I'm kind of bearish on security and privacy
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:15.520]   in general is because the past decade has taught me that humans tend to prioritize convenience
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:23.280]   over everything else. Even when it's in their best interests not to do so, this is just human
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:30.080]   nature and this is why it needs to be as convenient as possible to be your own bank.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:41.120]   But even stepping back from that, I do believe that Casa and my own journey, it'll be much
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:50.000]   bigger than just Bitcoin or just crypto assets. Fundamentally, the technology of cryptography
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   has the potential to change many different aspects of our lives. At a societal level,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:06.720]   it has helped to secure internet commerce as we know it. But the internet itself is still a crazy
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:13.520]   and dangerous place and there are many, many different areas that need room for improvement.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:20.560]   And so I think that we're going to see cryptography and the technologies that come
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.960]   out of this ecosystem be used to help people empower themselves in other ways.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:33.920]   So one example, social media, I'm a big fan of Nostra now. This is using public-private key
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:40.800]   cryptography. It's creating a completely different, more decentralized architecture
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:48.000]   for how we actually send and store the data for social networking. And even more than that,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.960]   it's actually much more than just a social network. I especially think that we will
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.920]   eventually land on some sort of identity solution. This is one of those unicorns,
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.800]   like a number of different teams have been working on for years and we have yet to settle
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.440]   on a standard. But I think that one of the big missing pieces to this whole
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:19.200]   sovereign ecosystem that we're trying to build on the internet is identity and reputation.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.840]   But we need to settle on exactly what system we're going to use for that. And
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:34.880]   it better not be WorldCoin is all I can say. >> It better not be WorldCoin, indeed.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:42.080]   Jameson, you've been enormously generous with your time as you always are with these interviews.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:50.640]   You're incredibly patient and giving in terms of your knowledge and your insight and your capacity
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:02:00.080]   to explain in very plain English and simple terms for us non-techies. You are a resource in your own
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:07.760]   right. You have a page that brings together all the most amazing resources in Bitcoin.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:17.920]   Do you have any last words or final thoughts or something that's really top of mind for you at
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.800]   the moment or something you'd like to get out there to anyone who might be listening
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:31.280]   who may be newer to this space? >> Basically, don't get overwhelmed.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:38.800]   Don't bite off more than you can chew. There's no rush on any of this. You can dip your toes in.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:45.360]   The most important thing that I think you can invest in is education. And so that's why
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:55.360]   I spend time almost every day updating my resources website. Every time I find a new tool
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.720]   or a new educational resource, I put it on there. Not just for everyone else. I initially started
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.720]   doing this for myself just because I wanted to be able to keep track of everything and be able to
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:12.160]   answer questions when people came to me so that I didn't have to go Googling all over the internet.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.080]   So yeah, there's no rush. You don't have to feel overwhelmed. You don't have to be technical. I
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:26.880]   think if you start going down the rabbit hole, if you think that this technology, the ideas behind
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:36.480]   these systems are interesting, if you think that this is perhaps a better way for us to try to move
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:44.000]   civilization forward in some aspects, I think that you should try to find a way to contribute.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.720]   There's many ways to do that. There's many companies out there that are looking for all
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:57.280]   types of different skill sets. You don't have to be a programmer by any means. And anything you do
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:05.360]   contribute is going to help us get to where we're all trying to go. So it can be adversarial,
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:14.080]   especially if you're trying to talk to people on social media. But this is a voluntary system,
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:22.240]   right? You don't owe anything to anyone. If someone is being mean to you, you can just
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:28.160]   stop talking to them. And I do that all the time. I wish I could even tell you how many thousands of
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.480]   accounts I've blocked and muted over the years, but Twitter won't make that easy for me to find
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:39.360]   out. I've just started doing that recently. I'm only just learning how to do that and how to
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   manage that. Jameson, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you being here. Thank you so much. And
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.440]   go well and be well and keep doing what you're doing. You're an amazing, amazing resource to
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:05:01.280]   this space. Thank you. Thanks for having me. I think that orthodoxy interprets aid and
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.640]   development as being wasteful, but probably good intention. It's probably what most people think of
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.240]   when they think about aid. But a lot of people are like, oh, my gosh, only a certain percentage
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.320]   of the money I send gets to the recipient. We should be doing more. That's what you hear a lot
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.440]   about in the mainstream economic orthodoxy is we're not doing enough lending to poor countries
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.480]   and we're not giving them enough capital and we're not giving them enough aid. That is profoundly
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:31.360]   incorrect in my view in as much as the aid and development industry as a whole is mainly lending,
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.240]   not gifts.

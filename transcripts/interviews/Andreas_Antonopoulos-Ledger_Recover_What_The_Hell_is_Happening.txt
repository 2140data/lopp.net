Hello, hello, everyone.
Welcome to this special public live stream.
We're going to be talking about Ledger Recover.
And this new service that they announced
has created quite a bit of controversy in the community.
Now, there may be a guest on this live stream.
Don't know if he'll be able to make it.
But if he does, we'll just pull him into the meeting
and get him on.
Jameson Lopp may be joining us.
We'll see how it goes.
Let me know in the chat if you can hear and see me well,
if everything's OK on your end.
Give us a little wave in the chat.
That would be great.
There's a slight delay between the video and the live.
So, oh, yeah, there we go, about five seconds.
So I will keep an eye on the chat,
just in case there's any questions or follow-ups
or things like that.
And otherwise, we'll get started here in just a second.
I hope you're all having a wonderful weekend.
And we're talking about Ledger's new service called Recover.
Now, this came to my attention primarily
because all of my public channels
just flooded with messages.
Oh, my God, what is happening?
Tell us more.
Figure this out.
And so I wanted to give you some of my opinions.
Oh, and there is Jameson.
One second, let's see.
All right, let's see.
Jameson, hello.
Hello.
We are live and streaming.
Welcome.
Welcome and hello from Bitcoin, Miami.
Oh, fantastic.
Must be-- I'm guessing it's hot and humid there at the moment.
Yeah, we've got plenty of air conditioning, though.
Oh, very good.
It's been a while since we last spoke.
Thank you so much for agreeing to jump on on short notice.
And I think the last time we did a live together, it was--
Ledger.
The last time Ledger had an oopsie.
Now, for those of you who don't know
about that previous occasion, you can find it on my channel.
It was a great conversation with two other friends,
with Taylor Monahan and Peter McCormick,
and of course, Jameson Lopp.
And we talked about Ledger's leak of their customer
database from their website, which
created quite a bit of, let's say, backlash,
as well as quite a few problems.
Jameson, can I ask you to just introduce yourself
for the audience who don't know you?
Yeah, I'm Jameson Lopp.
I am the co-founder and CTO of Casa.
We're a self-custody solution.
And I've basically spent the past eight years building
self-custody solutions.
Great, fantastic.
Thank you so much.
So one of the reasons you were one of the first people that
came to mind to me when I wanted to talk about this
is there are probably only a handful of true information
security and operational security experts
in our industry who are comfortable about talking
about these things publicly and sharing their risk analysis
and their thoughts on things like this.
I-- hopefully, I count myself as one of them.
And you were the first person who came to mind.
So I'm very glad you were able to join.
All right, so let's get started.
Let me give a bit of background.
So Ledger launched or announced a new service called Recover.
And what this service is is a service
that allows you to essentially share
three fragments of your seed before the seed is actually
produced through your Ledger device.
And those three fragments are then sent to three providers.
Ledger is one of them.
And if in the future you lose your seed,
you lose access to your seed, or something happens,
you can identify yourself and have them recover your seed
by assembling two of those three fragments.
So effectively, your seed is split into three pieces.
And any two of those pieces are sufficient to reconstruct
the seed.
This was announced with really not a lot of fanfare.
And the initial announcements didn't have a lot of detail.
And as a result, it created a bit of a crazed response
from the community, a panicked response from the community.
What are you doing to my devices?
And just maybe this morning, Ledger
published a much more detailed article and FAQ
and clarified many of those details.
Jameson, when did you first hear about this?
What was your first impression?
Yeah, I heard about it pretty much immediately
because we had a bunch of clients calling in saying,
oh, do I need to swap out my Ledger
for some other hardware manufacturer?
And the short version was no.
But that's because we put people into a multi-key,
multi-vendor setup.
So the whole idea is we understand
there is no perfect hardware device on the market.
The way that you get around these weaknesses
is by ensuring that any one weakness is not
going to create a catastrophic loss for you.
Now, I understood where Ledger is coming from.
And by that, I mean that if you are a sophisticated enough
user that you are purchasing and storing
your keys on a dedicated hardware device,
you're probably already in the top 1%
in terms of your security model.
So why would Ledger offer something like this?
Well, for any of us who have worked in the custody
space for even just a few years, it
becomes very apparent that the next most likely way for you
to screw up and lose your money if you have your keys off
of an internet-connected device is that you're most likely just
to lose it.
You don't have a good backup solution.
So what Ledger is trying to do is
they're trying to offer a user-friendly backup solution.
And of course, the devil's in the details.
The devil is indeed in the details.
So I would agree wholeheartedly here.
In fact, for most users, that is not even the second most likely
way to lose your funds.
It's the number one way to lose your funds,
is simply by misplacing or not sufficiently guarding
your seed.
The second most likely is probably
phishing attacks, where you're basically socially engineered
to give your seeds to someone by being told
you need to type it into a website
or you need to provide it to a service
because your account has been frozen.
We've seen a lot of those social engineering attacks.
Many people, even sophisticated users, have fallen for that.
And having your seed or your device stolen
is so far down the list, or your system hacked,
it's so far down the list of those risks
that it doesn't even really matter.
Unless you have unique circumstances that
make you a highly targeted public figure,
you're not going to have someone attempt to steal your Bitcoin.
They're just going to go for the easy marks.
And you're much more likely to lose it yourself.
So I understand the motivation for providing a recovery
service.
And just to clarify, that is kind of also what Kasa does.
And it's one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you
is because you have a lot of experience
in providing exactly this kind of recovery service.
But you do it in a very different way.
So to me, there are kind of three things
that are a bit of a concern when it comes
to how this service is built, how it was rolled out,
and the details of how it's implemented from a risk model.
But before we jump into that, already in the chat,
I'm seeing people say things like,
that's why I don't trust hardware wallets.
You should use a paper wallet.
I'm guessing somewhere soon we're going to see,
I built my own solution with Linux, Tails, a Raspberry
Pi, and some epoxy glue, whatever.
We're going to see a lot of those kind of reactions.
And I want to be very clear before we go into any detail.
A hardware wallet is the best and safest solution
for the vast majority of users.
99.99% of users still is.
Building your own, doing a DIY solution,
using obsolete paper wallets, trying
to do some weird encryption scheme,
using a USB stick, a custom Linux installation,
all of those things are much, much more
risky than simply buying and using a hardware wallet
correctly.
And the biggest risk with all of those solutions
isn't that you're going to get your keys stolen.
It's that you're going to make things so complicated that you
will inadvertently exceed your own technical capability
and lose access to your own keys by accident.
Or you'll create a solution where you've--
without really knowing what you've done,
you've shifted the risk model so far
into protecting the confidentiality of the keys,
but you've degraded availability,
availability being the ability to recover.
And at that point, you don't notice that
until you lose your seed.
Yeah, one way that I try to break this down
is actually a mantra that we see very often, safety in numbers.
Now, virus in numerous, this is a motto
that we see all the time.
And people usually talk about it in terms of cryptography
and the very large numbers that are used with private keys.
This actually applies in many different situations.
And one of them is just your own security model, your own setup.
If you have a novel setup, if it is a do-it-yourself thing
where you're potentially making decisions and going down
this logical path that few have ever tread before,
it's far more likely that there are
weaknesses in there that you've missed.
It's actually very similar to open source development.
The more eyes that you have on something,
the more likely it is the weaknesses
will be found and addressed.
And that's true with all of these hardware manufacturers
too.
Look, Ledger is a huge company.
They have a ton of money.
I'm sure they have a ton of engineers.
They have one of the most well-respected security teams
out there.
And they have put a ton of resources
into ensuring that their products are quite secure.
Yeah, interestingly enough, one of the articles
that did an analysis on Ledger's recover service
mentions that in the entire existence of the Ledger
company, which is almost 10 years old,
I think eight or nine years old now,
they had sold 5 million devices before FTX.
And then they sold another million devices just since FTX.
So that's obviously a huge number of new users.
So let's talk about recover in a bit more detail.
I'm going to throw out a few technical terms
for our audience.
Whether you are into the technical terms or not,
they won't be necessary to understand
what we're talking about.
First of all, how does Ledger split your seed?
They do so using an industry standard algorithm called
Shamir's secret sharing scheme.
And this is one of the few actually mathematically
provably secure cryptographic algorithms developed
by Shamir in the early '70s.
So it's a very old concept.
And it allows you to take any number
and split it into n independent shards, of which you
need k of those shards in a k of n scheme to recover it.
So let's say you split it into three shards, of which you
need two.
And you can calibrate Shamir's to do 3 of 5, 4 of 10,
26 of 1,024, or whatever combination you want.
In this particular case, they're doing a 2 of 3 Shamir scheme.
The algorithm is well understood, well known.
Basically, what the mathematical proof of Shamir sharing scheme
allows you to know is that having one shard
is mathematically equivalent to having no shards,
meaning you gain nothing from having only one of the n
shards.
If you have essentially anything less than k,
the quorum, the minimum number, which in this case is 2,
you have nothing.
It's not clear that what is transmitted from your ledger
device is just the shard, though,
because for obvious reasons, they
have to be able to identify which shard belongs to whom.
And so when you sign up for this service,
these shards would have to be attached somehow to you
so that they can identify you in case of a recovery.
The technical details don't really matter,
but there must be some identifier there.
And so very importantly here, and this
is a nuance in the FAQ, the original device
that did the split is not required for a recovery,
meaning that there is no secret encryption
key or other identifier that is tied to the original device.
You can lose the original device.
And they can recover to a new device
using only the shards and your identity,
which you prove to them by showing them a passport,
doing a live video interaction, probably waving your hand
in front of your face to prove that you're not a deepfake AI,
and things like that like we see nowadays.
So what do we know?
We know that this service allows you to split your seed
into three components.
All three components are sent out
of your device over the internet to three different providers.
These three providers have been identified as Ledger
themselves, the company, a company in, I believe,
the UK called CoinCover, and a third company in the US
called Escrowtech.
Each one of these companies will have only one of your shards.
There's a bit more information in their newest post.
They say they create an ephemeral encryption key
in order to transmit these.
And I'm going to take a guess here,
but I'm guessing what they're doing
is they have the public keys of Ledger, CoinCover,
and Escrowtech in the firmware of the device.
And the ephemeral encryption key is
created using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.
That would probably be the most standard way
of doing such a thing.
Again, these are robust, well-known encryption
mechanisms.
So then, OK, I mean, this sounds good.
It's based on open, well-known cryptographic algorithms.
But right away, I have three problems with the way
this was rolled out.
The first problem, and probably the most important problem,
is this is being pushed to Ledger Nano X, I believe, or--
I think it's everything after the S.
So my understanding is the Nano S does not
have sufficient memory to be able to perform the operations.
Right, so this is being pushed out
to all of the new Ledger devices.
It's being put into the firmware whether or not
you sign up for this service.
So the capability to export--
or some people might use the word
"exfiltrate" if they wanted to be meaner towards Ledger.
Exfiltrate, your private key, is being
embedded in the firmware of every Ledger device
the next time you update your firmware, whether or not
you choose to use this.
So that's problem number one.
And we'll go into a lot more detail with that.
Problem number two, because of the KYC requirements
for recovery and the fact that the original device isn't used
or needed to do a recovery, that means an identifier
that connects this shard to your identity
must be available to someone.
And third, these three companies are
located in three different countries, the US, the UK,
and France.
And they are entities subject to the jurisdiction
and legal process of both national and international
organizations.
And therefore, they can be coerced, perhaps only slightly
coerced, to give a shard to law enforcement,
given some process which you do not control, which would then
allow any law enforcement agency that
could get two of these companies to give the shard to seize
your money, freeze your money, reveal or find out
how much money you have stored on these device.
So these are the three big problems I have with this.
And we can look at them one by one.
Do you see any other really big concerns
that people have brought up?
Well, I think a lot of the outrage
was the fact that people have realized
that key exfiltration is possible.
And this is, I think, generally a misunderstanding
across the entire space of what the guarantees of these hardware
devices actually are.
Obviously, the firmware of these devices
can access the private key material.
People just haven't understood that you're hoping--
and especially in the case of Ledger being closed source,
you're trusting that they simply do not
make that functionality available.
So we can look at other devices.
And we can literally look at the APIs, the programming
interfaces that are made available to developers
such as myself when we want to interface with the device.
And we can see there is no way to make a call to that device
to ask for the private keys.
But that doesn't mean that that functionality
couldn't be added in the future.
Well, there is now.
In this particular case, there is a call
to be made because if you sign up for Ledger Recover,
you would obviously need to activate this.
Now, there is a key point to mention here,
which is that you would need to authorize it from the device.
And Ledger is saying that this is equivalent to authorizing
a signature from the device.
And it requires the same level of trust
the hardware manufacturer.
I disagree with that.
I think the fact that there is code that takes the key,
splits it into fragments, and sends it
to three different parties in the device
means that the barrier to exfiltrating the keys
is now I have to socially engineer the user
to do that and somehow compromise those keys.
But it now means that the code is in that device.
And the real problem is that even
if I haven't decided to participate in Ledger Recover,
the code for it is now going to be pushed from my device
if I connect it and allow it to do a firmware update.
So I didn't opt into the service,
but I am opting into the capability being
installed on my device, which in my opinion
makes it kind of a breach of the implicit relationship
between me and the manufacturer of this device
that I used to decide to buy it.
I bought this to do cold storage and self-custody.
I didn't buy this to do hybrid custody.
And I didn't consent to that.
So I did trust the manufacturer, of course.
I had to trust the manufacturer.
But I trusted the manufacturer based on, among other things,
assurances they made that you cannot ever take
the private keys off the device.
And now they've actually put code
in there that does exactly that.
So I have a problem with that.
Now, before people kind of jump to conclusions
and start running around, I think
it's important to mention a couple of things.
One, there will be a large number of phishing attacks
in the immediate aftermath of the controversy that
surrounded this that will attempt to persuade you
that in order to not have this feature,
you need to get this other firmware,
or you need to put your seed into this other website.
And in reality, people acting rashly, quickly,
with speed, panic, and kind of with a need
to do something quickly is often the way
that people lose money.
So my first advice would be, if you have money on a ledger that
has not been connected and had its firmware updated,
or it's an older model like the S,
you don't need to do anything.
Right now, you don't need to do anything.
Even if you have a ledger that's on the newer firmware
and maybe has even had that firmware installed on it,
you still don't need to do anything right now.
But you might want to think carefully
about whether you connect that ledger back to anything
and do a transaction.
Because the next time you connect it,
you're going to get the firmware updated,
and you now have a new capability in there,
which may not be on, but it's in.
And that's a problem, at least in my mind.
And that means you can also be socially engineered,
potentially, to participate in this scheme
without your knowledge.
So first of all, don't do anything.
The fundamental security model of hardware models
hasn't changed, of hardware wallets hasn't changed.
A ledger that you have and you've stored securely
where you have a good backup of your seat continues to mean--
it continues to be a perfectly suitable device
for cold storage.
You shouldn't be doing frequent transactions on that device
anyway.
I don't use a ledger for cold storage.
And I'll talk a bit about that in a second.
I do use a ledger for my operating account,
for things like my store and little expenses for my staff.
And I'm perfectly happy to continue using it for that,
because even if the system is completely compromised,
the loss is small.
So that's number one.
Right?
Would you agree with that assessment, Jameson?
Or do you have a different take on it?
Yeah, I mean, we're not advising anyone
that this is an emergency where you
need to stop what you're doing, because keys are at risk
immediately.
But we've been providing integrations
with a variety of different manufacturers over the years.
And firmware upgrades are just a part of life.
And this is another interesting point
to get into, the sort of open source versus closed source
nature of it, is that especially any closed source devices,
they could be giving you firmware updates.
And they could be providing key exfiltration functionality
in those updates and not telling you about it.
So you do at least have to get ledger some props
for being open about the fact that this is now being added.
They're not trying to hide it.
Obviously, the PR disaster is due to people
feeling like there have been certain trusts and assumptions
that have been broken as a result of it.
Yeah.
So we've got a few questions here.
Someone says, what happens if people don't update firmware
and you don't use it with Ledger Live,
you use it with a third-party program?
You can use it with MetaMask.
You can use it with Electrum for Bitcoin.
You can use it with any number.
There's probably 30 different software front ends for Bitcoin
and 30 more for Ethereum and other chains
that have hardware wallet interfaces that you
can plug your ledger into.
You don't need to use their software.
And in some cases, in some scenarios,
I certainly have found other pieces of software
have better things for managing fees
and are more up to date on some of the other features
you might care about.
So one of the key concepts of a hardware wallet
that you should always consider is that the companion software
is not necessary for you to be able to use that device.
And sometimes the companion software
isn't right for your needs.
Here's a caveat.
And this is something that's going to become an issue.
And it's the same thing with when, for example,
you have a fork in a chain.
If you refuse to do the update, your software is--
or your firmware, in the case of a hardware wallet,
is now in a state of decay.
And that decay occurs because the technology moves forward,
vulnerabilities are found, bugs are found,
little errors, inconveniences, perhaps not critical bugs,
but still annoying bugs, the overpay fees, for example,
or other things like that.
And so the longer you leave that device
without upgrading the firmware, the less useful
it becomes over time.
There's a very good chance that you will still
be able to access your Bitcoin, your Ether, et cetera,
but maybe some other more obscure chain is deprecated,
a new one is added that you haven't been able to use,
the fee management scenarios have changed,
new protocols for addresses are introduced.
So you'll still be able to use it, but it might not be fresh.
So one of the big considerations here
is if you let your ledger sit and rot
and refuse to do firmware updates,
effectively you're saying that you've given up on that device.
Maybe it's better to consider a new device
if you've reached that point in your risk analysis.
I mean, there's also a software dependency issue.
It's hard to put an exact time frame on it,
but whatever that companion wallet software you're using
is having to use software libraries to allow you
to interface with the hardware device.
And so generally over a long enough period of time,
they may upgrade the libraries that they're using
and in fact break the compatibility
with whatever your old firmware version is.
Yep.
And you say it's hard to put a time frame on that.
I found that after three or four years,
it starts getting tricky.
So I've had situations where I tried
to use an old hardware device, not just ledger, others too.
And the device drivers, the operating system infrastructure,
the libraries, the Python libraries,
the whatever else I need to use that has all changed
and maybe it doesn't support that old firmware version.
So that's a problem.
All right.
So the other...
So people who have ledgers, who bought ledgers before,
this was available,
who do not intend to use the recovery feature
are now facing a rather awkward kind of dilemma
or conundrum.
Do I still use this device knowing that they might add
some unnecessary features,
which slightly maybe increase my risk?
Maybe it doesn't.
We don't know.
We can't know.
And, or do I switch to a new device?
And first of all, I would say there's no urgency here.
So I would say that if you do decide to switch
to another device, don't try to rush this process.
Very carefully, get a new device, get familiar with it,
set up a new seed, figure out all of the mechanics,
test it, back it up, restore it, wipe it, restore it again,
make sure everything's working, send a small test amount,
send it back out after wiping it.
And once you're very, very comfortable,
maybe then you should move your money off that seed.
I would certainly do that from my perspective.
And I take my time doing that.
If you decide you want to use the ledger recover service,
you should know the risks that come with that.
And I think the risks that ledger is most underplaying
are the risks of a government imposed seizure
or freezing of these things.
They basically de-decentralized this.
They've taken a self custody solution.
And if you use recover,
it's essentially a hybrid custody solution,
if not a custodial solution.
And those custodians can be coerced to seize your money
or reveal how much money you have.
- We also don't know what the social engineering risk is.
I guess we don't know exactly
what the authentication procedures will be
if you are a ledger recover user
and how an attacker might be able to pretend to be you
and you convince them to basically let an attacker
reconstitute your private keys.
- Yes.
Back in the day, I tried to build a company
to help do this kind of recovery.
We called it third key recovery solutions
or third key solutions.
And what I found was the inflection point was
you can either do this at very high levels of security
and authentication, or you can do it at scale, but not both.
A ledger is saying you can do up to three changes a month
and no more than 10, up to three recoveries a month
and no more than 10 per year per user.
They have 6 million users.
If this has any uptake whatsoever,
the actual standards they're going to have to use
for identifying users are going to have to be fairly soft.
And the other thing I'm thinking about
is they've talked about how the shards are stored
in hardware security modules by the three escrow companies.
- That generally means internet connected.
- That means internet connected HSMs
that are API driven.
It doesn't mean HSMs that are air gapped
with further fragmentation of the private keys
to access the HSMs and multi-user, multi-factor,
insert three cards for many of the five executives
'cause that doesn't scale for operational reasons.
And to add another concern,
all of this is happening just when the ability for AI
to deep fake voice and video
has gotten so incredibly sophisticated.
So again, this is one of those difficult situations
where I don't know if they can do this at scale
without sacrificing security.
I do know someone who can do this at scale
and that's the US government in unmasking,
seizing and freezing assets of people all around the world.
They can do that at scale.
And so that's the other big concern I have.
The UK, the US and France
are not three wholly independent countries.
They're all members of the Five Eyes surveillance network.
They're very strong military partners.
They collaborate on a number of law enforcement things.
Two of them are in Europol.
One of them controls international law enforcement
in many ways.
And the irony that struck me
is one of the reasons I got into Bitcoin
and one of the things that was monumental,
instrumental in my initial adoption
and interest in the technology
was this started with WikiLeaks trying to fundraise
while Julian Assange was being accused of treason
for revealing the war crimes
of the British and American government.
And guess what?
The US and the UK are collaborating very closely
to punish a journalist
who told the world about their war crimes.
And Assange is the victim of that close collaboration.
So two of the three shards being in the UK and the US,
they might as well be in the same place
as far as I'm concerned.
That is not filled me with confidence.
- Yeah, and we can talk about,
obviously the technical details all day long,
but I think another easy way to give people an idea
of really what the security,
even from Ledger's perspective of this particular feature is
I believe in their documentation,
they were suggesting that you not do it
for more than $50,000 worth of money.
- That's the insurance provided
by one of their partners CoinCover
so that if something goes wrong and you lose your money
because of this, they cover you up to 50,000.
Again, so, okay, so maybe this is really targeted
for operational wallets
and the vast, 50,000 is a lot of money
for the vast majority of the 6 million people
who have Ledger devices.
I would guess that 90% of them have less than 50,000
on those devices.
So maybe it's a suitable.
So you have to think about this
from your own risk management perspective.
Are you comfortable with a hybrid custody solution
that is not exactly as custodial as a single exchange?
It's not exactly as self-sovereign
as a much more decentralized solution.
And the one your company provides is an example of that.
And so you have to kind of balance these risks out.
I don't think there's any reason to worry about that
unless you wanna take advantage of that service.
So the final kind of thing that comes out of this
is how this was all rolled out.
I don't know what the hell is happening at Ledger,
but when you're dealing with a community
that is as careful, some would say paranoid,
certainly tuned in and ready to jump
and worried about geopolitics
as the community in the cryptocurrency space is,
you don't design and deliver a feature like this
with very little independent audit,
with very little independent oversight,
with a modicum of half-failed answers
and then let PR manage the ensuing crisis.
This is another example, I think,
of Ledger being really tone deaf
to this community and its concerns.
- Yeah, I mean, my take was that
they probably had plenty of internal meetings
and they were running some numbers
and they were saying, like you were saying,
probably the vast majority of our users have under 50,000
and this will help a lot of them not lose their keys.
And I think they were probably just focused
on the market segment that they're targeting here.
And it seems like they just forgot
about the rest of the market
that is not interested in that.
- Yeah, absolutely.
And didn't learn from past experiences
of very badly managing the aftermath
of a botched situation as happened
with the leak of their database.
So I don't use, I mentioned before,
I don't use a Ledger for cold storage.
I use it for an operational account only
and maybe that's exactly their target market.
If you are using a Ledger for cold storage
and you want to switch to another solution,
as I mentioned before, I would start with a fresh seed.
It doesn't have to be 24 words,
as someone said in the chat, 12 is enough.
And this is because the fundamental security
of the elliptic curves is really 128 bits.
So 12 words is enough and is easier to not lose and back up.
But you must test it.
The way I test it is I create, generate the new seed.
I back it up on a durable medium.
Steel is my preferred solution.
I think I have, actually I have one of the devices
I use here.
Let's see.
This I've shown it to you before.
It's a crypto steel capsule.
I'm sure you know this one, Jameson.
And what it is, is a series of stamped disks
that have letters on them that go around a rod
and inside the steel tube,
the whole thing is stainless steel,
impervious to fire, corrosion, floods, whatever.
Great, that solves it.
I then wipe the device or I send a dollar to it.
Then I wipe it.
And then I recover from that,
from the actual thing that I'm going to recover.
So I'm training and recreating the exact circumstances
of a zero basis recovery,
where I start from the only backup that I have left to me,
which is the stamped steel, all the way back,
and then try to send that dollar back to myself
and execute a signature and transaction.
Once I've done that,
I know that I have a complete operational cycle
for that device.
Now, obviously that's a one copy.
You would probably want two copies of your seed.
And then if you want to get into more complicated things,
there's a number of other options.
For Bitcoin, I'll tell you my recommendation.
For Bitcoin only solutions, I use a cold card.
Again, I happen to have my,
the Velcro ripping you here is the Faraday bag they're in.
So this is a cold card.
It's a transparent case.
You can actually see all of the hardware inside.
This is a Bitcoin only cold storage device.
It's completely air gap to use an SD card inside
to move stuff from one device to another.
There are a number of other hardware wallets you can use.
I'm not gonna show you the rest.
For if you want to do multi-currency,
there are other wallets that are available to you.
I quite like the Trezor,
which is the original hardware wallet that I bought.
They're obviously a direct competitor to Ledger.
And I would say that at least,
I don't wanna say they've done a better job
because I think Jameson, you were very gracious
in saying that they think of the market
that they're addressing.
And that market is low value, not cold, cold storage,
not particularly paranoid about government action
and more interested in an investment vehicle
and adoption of this.
And for that market, maybe this is the right answer.
I can tell you one thing,
the people who make Trezor
were never going after that market.
And they make decisions that indicate that.
One of the things that I find disappointing here
is the way that these decisions were made by Ledger.
And I wish they had better ways of communicating.
No hardware wallet is perfect.
Someone else pointing out Trezor has issues too.
They're partnering with a company that supports censorship.
I would take that with a grain of salt,
but every company has issues.
Companies are entities.
They're subject to various jurisdictional environments.
They have decisions made by fallible humans, every company.
But I will say that, and going back to how we started this,
a hardware wallet is still better than the DIY solution
that you carve your own path through the jungle
and hope that it's a good path.
And it's much less likely to cause you to lose money.
All right, I think we've covered a lot of things.
Let's see if there are any final questions on the chat.
And then maybe, Jameson,
maybe you have some additional thoughts to wrap up on.
- Yeah, you know,
Kasa, my company has been focused
on the super extreme cold storage solutions.
And we're able to do that
because these hardware companies
don't necessarily target the same market.
You know, like you said, there's trade-offs with everything.
You can go to the extreme
with any of the decisions that you're making
when trying to architect your setup.
And that's what we try to do
is help people think of absolutely everything
that can go wrong.
Because, you know, let's be honest that, you know,
regardless of if you're using cold card,
Trezor, Ledger, Bitbox, whatever,
those are still, you know,
physical single points of failure, right?
You don't have redundancy.
You kind of touched on it a little bit
with some of like the seed backup problems
that like, if you really wanna have
robust redundant seed backups,
then you actually need to do
like some splitting of the seeds.
Maybe you wanna do a seeds or of your seeds.
And we start going down these rabbit holes that, you know,
we could spend the rest of the day talking about.
- Yep.
And one of the challenges there is that
for people who are experts
who are designing possible solutions
for different levels of risk,
these kinds of decisions about,
should I split?
Should I use a passphrase?
Should I do more than just the basics?
Are very carefully balanced
and they're balanced across multiple concerns
and multiple possible threats.
When, let me put it this way,
when amateurs do this,
when non-professional people who haven't been trained,
don't have experience in information security
trying to do this,
one of the difficulties is there's two hidden variables
that they often overlook in their assessments.
The first one is violating the keep it simple,
stupid rule, the KISS rule of security,
which is security that is simple to execute,
simple to operate,
is usually going to be more successful
than overly complex things.
And the problem is that keeping it simple
is relative to your own technical expertise
and the technical expertise of the people
who will clean up after you when you're run over by a bus,
the family that you hope to leave
your oodles of Bitcoin to.
Between those two principles,
a lot of people make a very obvious and bad mistake,
which is they make something too complex.
It either exceeds their technical ability
to operate it consistently
and then they lose their keys by accident,
or it certainly exceeds the technical ability
of their heirs to operate.
And because it's a path no one has gone down before,
or it hasn't been sufficiently documented,
no one can figure where the treasure is buried.
So the reason why a treasure hunting stories
is so appealing in popular culture
is because people violated the KISS rule
and buried their treasure through layers and layers
and layers of obfuscation.
The Da Vinci Code would be a very boring movie
if someone had a well-developed operational security manual
that they'd left behind.
So one is that, and the other one is,
the other hidden variable that will bite you in the ass
is that while you can see all of the things you're doing
to make it harder for someone to steal your money,
you're not seeing all of the compromises you're making
in the overall availability and recoverability
because you don't exercise recoveries often enough.
And so an amateur will make something very hard to steal
at the expense without realizing that this is a trade-off
of making it recoverable,
and then will lose the seeds themselves
and not be able to recover it.
So be very careful.
Generally, I recommend people do not do DIY solutions,
Glacier Protocol, paper wallets, et cetera, et cetera.
There is one nuance here and a question from the chat
that I want to ask and answer.
Jeremy asks, "What if there was a passphrase
on the seed phrase with a ledger?
Would that be sharded off also,
or would that be on the end user to keep safe?"
There's no clarity in the documentation of ledger,
so I'm going to make a guess here.
The ledger says specifically the what they shard
is your pre-BIP39 seed,
meaning essentially the random number
that the seed is built from, right?
That the words are built from.
The passphrase isn't added until after BIP39
converts the number into words,
and therefore the passphrase,
by all documentation that I've seen,
and again, the documentation is lacking, is not backed up,
meaning that if you have a passphrase,
you still need that to recover,
and absent that, you cannot do a recovery.
Here's the little problem though,
and I think this is important to understand.
That's actually not a security benefit.
That's a recovery disability,
because if you forget your passphrase,
it will be very difficult for you to recover,
but if I don't have your passphrase,
and all I'm trying to do is crack your passphrase
'cause I have the seed, it is not impossible.
So let's talk about that very briefly to explain it.
There was a really, and I'll go a bit technical
for those who are interested.
There was a very interesting compromise
made in specification of BIP39,
given the hardware capabilities of the device
that it was going to run on,
and that was to use only 2000 rounds
of the key stretching algorithm PBKDF2
in the use of the passphrase.
That means if you're trying to brute force this,
you have to pick a passphrase, guess a passphrase,
and then you have to run that passphrase
through 2000 rounds of a hash stretching algorithm,
and then you can test to see
if those addresses have money in them.
That takes time, but because this was designed
to run on a little device this big,
which was a very simple 32-bit processor
with not much RAM, they limited it to 2000 rounds.
I wanna give you a bit of a reference for that.
Modern day password managers like Bitwarden
or LastPass that you use for that
are now recommending a minimum number of rounds
set to 100,000 rounds, not 2000, so 50 times more.
And many sophisticated users will set it
to a minimum of 500,000 or a million rounds
because on my laptop, on my iPad, on my Android phone,
running a million rounds
of the password stretching algorithm
still only takes about half a second to a second.
If you are a determined attacker
who has a couple thousand machines
in a warehouse or data center running with GPU acceleration,
or you have the money to rent that on demand
or spot pricing from Amazon,
you can brute force a short passphrase
with 2000 rounds effectively.
It may take you a month, but you can do that.
And the problem is there,
you're running into this very difficult balance,
which is if you make your passphrase too long,
once again, you just traded confidentiality
for availability, you're much more likely
to fuck up the recovery
and never be able to get back to your money
'cause you made your passphrase too long and complex
and didn't back it up.
And it still won't thwart a determined adversary.
For example, our friends at the National Storage Agency
from being able to brute force that trivially
with the hardware that they have.
So that's to give you,
so that's not really the saving grace that you think it is
for the security model.
- Yeah, I mean, I'll say anecdotally,
I think pretty much anyone who has worked
in the self-custody space,
we've seen a lot of people just lock themselves
out of their money because they put a passphrase on it
and forgot it.
It might also be worth noting though,
that this type of like Shamir secret sharing
of the backup key,
it's actually something that's possible
for people to do themselves if you have a Trezor.
I guess, I don't think you went into it too much,
but Shamir secret sharing can be a little tricky
if you're implementing,
if you're running your own implementation of it,
there have been a number of times out there
where software implemented it
and they accidentally had weaknesses.
But Trezor's Shamir secret sharing is their own,
it's not a Bitcoin improvement,
it's a slip, Satoshi Labs improvement proposal.
- Yes, slip 30 points specifically
if our mods could link that in the chat.
Yeah, go ahead.
- Yeah, I mean, it's well vetted
and that is something that I would feel safe recommending
for people to do if you want it to go down that path.
- Yeah, and so I recommend if you have a seed
and you want to make sure that your seed
is both more available,
'cause you have more than one copy,
but more also less easy to steal,
the correct answer to do it
is not to come up with your own scheme,
but to use something like slip
to break it into a two or three shard situation,
store those three shards securely.
And even if someone gets those shards,
they can't easily,
they'd have to get to two of those shards
in order to be able to break in.
By the way, the other thing is silly,
but very simple security mechanisms
that people forget about.
When you store, let's say you steal backup
and let's say you do your steel backup
for your three shards,
of which two are required for recovery.
When I store shards or seeds that are sensitive
that I have money on,
and I really want to know
if someone's ever been able to access that,
this looks fairly dumb and simple,
but you can get a hundred of these bags from Amazon.
These are tamper evident bags.
These ones are from,
well, there we go, MMF Industries.
They sell these for churches
so they can collect cash
without all of the godly people stealing the cash
because trust in God,
but trust in MMF Industries more.
And what this is, is a bag that once you seal,
the seal here is heat proof, cold proof,
crack proof, tear proof,
and it cannot be opened without distorting it,
without leaving evidence that you opened it.
So you take your steel backup,
you pop it in the bag,
you sign on the outside of the bag
so that you can recognize your own signature,
and you record the serial number,
which is unique over there.
You seal the bag, you put it in a safe.
And now you know if someone's been at your seed
and you need to do something,
for example, protect the other two shards
or move your money or something like that.
So that's another little bit of advice.
And all of this ties into a bigger question,
which Lux Blocks just asked,
which is what is the best way to plan succession
in case I die?
I don't want my family to have the access to the wallets
when I'm still alive.
You want them to have, as we say in the industry,
you want them to have access to your money
after you die and not a minute before.
(laughs)
- Yeah, too bad that usually runs into the Oracle problem.
Though, there's some improvements in Bitcoin scripting,
I think that will make inheritance more feasible.
- Yeah, the problem with this
is more often not technology, but people.
Your cousin Charlie, who is a lovely person now,
but is a meth addict six months from now,
is the one who's gonna get you.
And that's where the problem lies.
For advice on that,
one of the people I've worked with in the past
is Pamela Morgan,
who wrote the "Crypto Assets Inheritance Planning"
for owners.
And that's a book that looks at the technical, legal,
and operational or people aspects of this problem,
because it's a three-dimensional problem.
There's people issues, there's technical issues,
and there's also legal issues,
where you need to make sure that what you did
is also compatible so that your heirs
don't end up suing each other
and giving all of the money to the lawyers.
So have we beaten this dead horse enough, Jameson?
- Yeah, I mean, I think we hit the high level points.
It's not a super emergency,
but I think it's another good forcing function
just to get people to think more carefully
about exactly what their security model is.
It's very easy to make assumptions
about your security model,
especially if you're not an expert.
- Yep, and one piece of advice that I try to follow myself
and I give to others is review your security,
your backups, your password storage, your safe,
your important documents, your wills, once a year.
I usually spend the day after New Year's Day
doing exactly that,
or at least within the first week of the year,
I do a comprehensive review of all of those things,
make sure I know where my seeds are,
what devices I have,
if I've opened any new accounts that I didn't do last time,
if my passwords are secure, if my family is informed,
if I have my will updated,
all of those little things that we leave
'cause life gets too busy.
All right, I think that's a great point.
And PM Mod says, "Casa is another option.
"They work with people to create inheritance planning."
I know that's one of the service offerings
you have for inheritance planning.
- Yeah, I mean, the short version is,
when you're paying for Casa,
yeah, you're getting software and stuff,
but a lot of it and a lot of the heavy lifting,
you're really paying for consultation.
And it's because, as should be obvious from anyone
who's heard the complexity of some of the stuff
we've talked about today,
these can be very personal and individual problems
and people have different needs.
And so it's very difficult,
even for experts to be talking about these issues
because in many cases, we have to be a little hand wave.
You have like, well,
there's a whole plethora of different options
and we cannot prescribe one specific option
that will broadly apply for everyone and everyone's needs.
Just like I can't go and say,
everyone should use this one hardware manufacturer.
It's because they all have different strengths
and weaknesses and it's important just for people
to evaluate their own needs
and evaluate what the possibilities are.
- Yeah, and I think to people's great relief,
the security models that you and I have to run
are very, very different from those
that most people have to run.
They're lucky in that way, but still distinct.
All right, Jameson, thank you so much.
I know this was last minute and you're at a conference.
I hope you enjoy the rest of Miami.
I really appreciate you contributing
to this conversation today.
- Glad to be here as always.
- All right, thank you all for joining.
Have a wonderful weekend.
Bye-bye everyone.

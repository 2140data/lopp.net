So there's one person on the stage here that is not up there. Why?
Hi, everyone. My name is Nifty. I'm going to be moderating this panel today.
We're here to talk about CISA, I think, cross-input signature aggregation.
And joining me today on the stage, I have Jameson Lopp from Casa,
Craig Raw of Sparrow Wallet, and Fabian Jahr of Brink.
So welcome them to the stage. Really appreciate it.
Great. So we're excited to be talking to you guys about this.
I think it'd be great maybe to start off hearing a little bit more about who's on our panel today.
So if panelists, you could tell the audience about the project that you're working on
and where you first heard about CISA from. That makes sense.
So Craig, do you want to start?
So I built Sparrow Wallet. It's a security and privacy-focused wallet.
The first time I heard about CISA was really from other privacy activists in the Bitcoin space
who were talking about how they were really hoping that this cross-input signature aggregation
was going to be shipped as part of the taproot upgrade.
And obviously we know that that didn't happen.
So when you're looking at things from a privacy point of view,
you want to do things like create multi-party transactions.
And as we will hear, cross-input signature aggregation really provides an interesting basis
for being able to do that with more economic benefits.
So that was the first time that I really started to look at it was from the privacy angle.
Yeah, I primarily work on Bitcoin Core.
And I can't really remember a specific time when I heard about it for the first time.
The time between the secrete soft fork and the taproot soft fork
was really when I got deeper into Bitcoin and started contributing to Bitcoin Core.
And somehow it was always there.
And only when I started researching on CISA and going deeper into it over the last couple of months,
I saw also that historically it was a topic that was brought up
and that was discussed to be part of the taproot soft fork.
But then at some point it was cut basically to keep the scope smaller.
And so I guess at some point around the time I saw it and then it was removed
and I never really paid much mind to it around the time.
And when I reviewed the taproot soft fork, it was not in there.
So I kind of forgot about it for probably one or two years.
But it kept popping up on taproot.
Also like Craig said, more privacy-minded people.
And that triggered me to look deeper into it.
I'm Jameson Lopp.
I work on Casa where we help people get into highly distributed,
secure, multi-signature, self-custody setups.
And I could be misremembering because it's been several years,
but I think the first time that I heard about CISA was an Andrew Poelstra talk.
And I mostly remember being blown away by the vision that he painted
of basically a future in which we were all financially incentivized
to participate in CoinJoin transactions for everything that we transacted
and basically breaking a lot of the potential for chain surveillance
to be watching everything that we're doing.
Because I think if we're all honest with each other,
Bitcoin has some pretty poor privacy characteristics.
That's a great point.
Wow, yeah.
Okay, so I think now that we've kind of had an intro into how each of you
came to hear about it, maybe some of the things that you thought were
important or cool when you first heard about it,
maybe we could take a little bit of time to explain a little bit more
what CISA is and what those letters stand for.
Does anyone have a good explanation of how it works?
I can sort of.
So it's really already all in the name.
Cross-Input Signature Aggregation.
So if you think of a Bitcoin transaction as it looks today,
you have sometimes one but often multiple inputs.
And with each of the input, usually a signature is associated.
And what the linearity property of short signatures allows you to do
is to aggregate these signatures.
And you can aggregate them across the different inputs that you have
in a transaction.
And so that means that in the future, we could have transactions
that have multiple inputs.
If you think specifically about transactions that have a lot of
inputs like coins, for example, as we just mentioned,
these could have just one signature then.
And depending on what technique you use,
these can be just as big as one single signature before.
And of course, that saves a lot of space both on-chain and also
in terms of the fees because you take up less space in a block.
That is the general idea.
I have a quick question about that.
So whenever you say you can do cross-input signature aggregations
like on a transaction, usually you'll have a couple of things
called inputs, and each of those inputs will have a signature on it, right?
So kind of the general idea is that on that same one signature,
instead of having a couple of them,
you kind of be able to roll them all up and just have a single signature.
Is that a good summary of what you're explaining?
Yeah, I would say so.
Okay.
Yeah, so there's two major ways to do this.
The one is what we call a half signature aggregation
or half ag as we abbreviate it.
And that's basically where you don't have any kind of need
for an interactive process.
Anybody can take all of the signatures that appear currently
for every input in a transaction and they can aggregate them into one.
Now the size of that one is unfortunately not the size of a normal signature.
It's a slightly bigger one.
In fact, that size is determined by the number of inputs that you have.
So that's one way to do it.
And then there's a more comprehensive way to do it
which is called full signature aggregation.
That gets you really like a much more compact signature
which is the aggregate of all of the other ones.
Unfortunately, the downside of that is that you have to do this interaction
while you sign.
And the problem with that is that interaction is always contains a lot of complexity.
So unless you own all of the inputs,
you are going to have to interact with all of your,
everyone else who's adding an input to that transaction.
And that creates obviously a much more difficult process in terms of signing.
And as a result, we generally,
at least I personally am more excited about the kind of half signature aggregation
because it's just so much easier to do and gets you a lot of the benefits
even though it's not quite as efficient.
Cool.
So it sounds like we're taking signature data
and it's all the same signature data in like a single transaction, right?
You wouldn't have multiple transactions that you're doing.
It's like on a single transaction level.
Well, there's also full block aggregation, right?
This is going really far down the rabbit hole
and I think that it's not even something that is on the table once again
because there's too many additional edge cases, I guess, that come up,
especially when you start thinking about like reorganizations of the blockchain.
And my understanding is you would basically have to have like this other mem pool
to keep track of things that were not sufficiently buried enough in the blockchain
that they could be reorganized because if there was a reorg,
it would not be as simple as how we do reorgs right now
where we just take every transaction out and put it back into the mem pool and start over again.
Great.
Cool.
So it sounds like you're saying there's a couple of different ways we could do signature aggregation.
We could do it at the transaction level.
We could have a proposal to be able to do it at the block level.
But again, there's some trade-offs there.
So one of the nice things if you were able to take basically signature aggregation at the block level
would mean that you take all the signatures anywhere in any transaction inside a block
and for that you'd create like maybe a single signature object, right?
Maybe it's not exactly a signature, but something similar to that.
Why is one reason that you would want to even do this?
It sounds complicated, but...
Yeah, well, so there's the privacy characteristics improvements,
but also, you know, I think it's interesting whenever we're talking about incentivizing people economically.
So if anyone was around and paying attention in 2016, 2017,
when we were talking about segregated witness,
there was this concept of a witness discount.
It was basically put in place to help incentivize people
to help rebalance the cost between creating a UTXO and spending a UTXO.
Basically, you run into some problems where if you're receiving a lot of transactions,
you're basically creating a lot of unspent transaction outputs in your wallet,
it becomes problematic if at some point in the far future you want to go spend them
and perhaps the fee rates in the market for block space have gone up a lot.
It can become insanely expensive to spend your own money
and this inevitably catches a lot of people by surprise
if they haven't been through like a full market cycle before.
So I think this is another potential interesting aspect of aggregation
is that once again, we would be pushing the balance forward
a bit to help incentivize people to clean up their UTXOs
because we're not penalizing them as much by making it really expensive to do so.
Maybe to expand on that.
So there is a financial incentive then for people to participate in coin drawings
and that gives them additional privacy
and the nice effect of that also is that hopefully this would lead to also
like wider adoption of coin drawing,
which means that when more people are coin drawing,
that's a higher anonymity set that benefits everyone that is after this anonymity property
but also everyone that participates in this coin drawing can also use this
as a plausible deniability even if they are doing it primarily for the privacy aspect
but they can also always say like, hey, I'm saving fees here.
So that's my primary motivation
and hopefully a further trickle down effect would be that
like when people are more asking for this,
when this becomes more wide stream adopted,
then also more and more wallets adopt this,
easier to use wallets, complexity gets hidden
and it becomes more of a mainstream feature.
Yeah, I mean we have to think about the incentives, right?
You know, I consider myself a cipherpunk, I'm a big privacy advocate,
I would assume we all are but the reality of the situation is
and this is pessimistic, most people don't care about privacy
or they don't care until it's too late
and so we can stand up here and we can talk about how awesome it is
to have really strong privacy and like why you should be using all of these
insane tools that are very niche right now
but if we actually want people to adopt privacy tools,
we need to give them the financial incentive to do so.
It should not be a situation where the average person should be going out
and basically asking their wallet providers or other software developers
to please bake in additional privacy tools and protections into the software,
really it should be why are you making me spend more of my money
to use Bitcoin when you could be using this technology
that you know it happens to enhance privacy but it's actually saving me money.
Yeah, so you might be wondering at this stage what are the savings actually look like
and it turns out that if you apply what I was describing earlier
this half signature aggregation technique
you can fit about 20% more average size transactions into a block
so you can immediately think that that's going to reduce the average fee level
for any point in time people submitting transactions to the mem pool to be included in a block
you can now fit 20% more average size transactions into that block
and that obviously is a big advantage.
Now the actual effect on a particular transaction
because of the witness discount that James had mentioned earlier is actually less
so there you've got like a 7% to 8%
but remember that the average fee rate is going to be lower
because again we're fitting more transactions into a block
which just means there's less pressure on block space
so that's how I would encourage you to think about it from the start
like for me the efficiency in terms of block space is a good reason to do this anyway
regardless of whether we get privacy benefits
it's almost like the privacy benefits come along for the ride
we actually have this really restricted data space in the blockchain
and if we can apply a fairly simple and low-risk form of compression
I think it's a serious thing to think about.
I think now that we've sort of talked about how great this is
we're going to get more transactions in a block
we're going to save money, we're going to get better privacy
I'd be really interested to hear why it didn't make it into Taproot originally
like is there any opposition to this proposal
what was it about Taproot or like the Taproot process
where this proposal didn't quite make it over the line?
So I mean I was not in the room when this...
I don't think any of us were in the room
but I mean I've read all of the transcripts that were available
from when these things were discussed
and what I can say like I think there was no direct opposition also
I think the primary motivator was to keep Taproot manageable
in terms of review effort and just keep the scope smaller
and I mean the only thing that I could see really between the lines
what Greg already kind of mentioned is that
if you just look at the pure fee savings numbers
the numbers of weight units that you save
if you just throw that over to somebody that it's
for half aggregation in the single digits
then people are often a bit disappointed as a first reaction
and you have to really discuss it and fill it a bit more with this understanding
and I think that made it also have turned off some people
and like why maybe also developers felt like
this would be the easiest thing to chop off
but that people wouldn't miss as much
Yeah so I think in terms of the whatever pushback I have heard so far
is what Fabian was saying that it doesn't do enough
I think that there's a general perception that
we can only ever push for one soft fork at a time
so all the soft forks have to compete to be the one
which is an interesting point of view
It's interesting because I was in the room in Hong Kong
when Peter Willa announced that we were changing the flagging system
so that we could do like 32 soft forks in parallel
and of course we have not yet taken advantage of that
Yeah so you know we're in a very different space from that now
I think you know something to bear in mind
if you're thinking about it from that point of view is that
and I heard Brandon Black actually was here earlier today
talking about Opcat is that I think Caesar is probably the most low risk
soft fork that we could imagine
and I'm talking about here about the well understood
half signature aggregate form of it
you know it's really from a security model point of view
the cryptographers tell us that there is no risk
effectively or very low risk to doing this
it really takes very well understood properties of Schnorr
which is really just adding these signatures up
and uses that
so in terms of risk of doing the soft fork
it's not really enabling other things that Bitcoin can do
it's not going to be some kind of ungrounded
it's really just compressing
and if you think about it compression is a fairly bounded area
you're not going to suddenly have people developing all kinds of
perhaps unwanted things on top of Bitcoin
just because you have compressed the signature size down
so maybe it opens up the space for other soft forks
if we do a soft fork which has such low risk to it
that it actually gets across the line
I think it's also worth noting that this is by no means
the only signature aggregation scheme
that's even happening in Bitcoin right
is that like with the taproot soft fork a few years ago
we did get the theoretical ability to do Schnorr signatures
but that has been an ongoing process right
so as far as I'm aware off the top of my head
there's a pretty limited amount of adoption of Schnorr so far
because I think Musig 2 is the main production ready standard
that people are using and that can only do an N of N
like a 2 of 2 or a 3 of 3 type of scheme
so it's kind of limited in its flexibility
and I care about this a lot
operating a multi-signature self-custody wallet
we're waiting for the further evolution of threshold signature
schemes like Frost that can do more arbitrary
K of N type of multi-sig
and that evolution that research is still ongoing
we're continuing to see like new iterations of Frost come out
and so we do expect that we will start to see more adoption
of aggregated signatures across the ecosystem
but the ultimate end goal would be something where like
there's only one signature per block
like the final form of SIGAG as we go all the way to the block level
so we only have a few minutes left
maybe we can spend a little bit of time talking about
okay so we almost had it, we didn't get it
what would it take, like what's left from here to get it to the point
where we could soft fork it in
there's still quite a few things to hammer out in terms of
all of the details defining a spec
so for the half arc there's BIP draft
but it's not a pull request on BIP repository
but it's, they're just minded to do like test vectors
there that are open
however for the full aggregation
we still need to develop the signature scheme
so that requires quite a bit of effort
from people reversed in cryptography
and specifically on the side of the interactivity
and we will also want to have a security proof
for that scheme that comes out on the other hand
that means people with very specific talents
and experience in that area will also be needed in process
so these I think are the big to-dos that we have
and the people that can do this stuff
need to come together and work on it
personally I spend quite a bit of time on it right now
but maybe something to everyone watching this
or in the audience if you want to get involved let us know
Call your local developer and demand signature aggregation today
Yeah and just to that point
Fabian has developed a great site where you can learn more
so if the concepts that we've talked about here today
make sense if you want to understand them better
you go to CISAResearch.org
at C-I-S-A Research.org
you can really learn much more about it
it's very easy to read, it's not going to be overly technical
and I think it gives a good grounding in these things
and then largely the way that soft forks happen
is that people need to express views about them
and ultimately we need to develop some form of rough consensus
around whether we want to do it or not
so as far as I'm aware this is the first panel we've had
which talks about it, it is still
even though it's an old concept and it's a simple concept
we don't really have a lot of discussion about it right now
so talk about it
try and develop an understanding of what it is that it's trying to do
and see whether you want to have it in Bitcoin or not
I don't know, do you want to save money?
it should be an easy question

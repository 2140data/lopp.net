Good morning bitcoins and welcome to mad bitcoins live. This is part three of our scaling discussion
We had part one on monday night with roger veer part two last night with peter todd
And now according to flibber on twitter the bitcoin blocks are getting closer and closer together
With bitcoin core blocks going down and bitcoin unlimited blocks going up the closer these lines come together
The closer we are to forking
We're joined by Jameson Lopp from bitgo and ret creighton from z classic and a member of bitcoin unlimited Jameson
How's it going? Welcome to the show
Not bad. It's exciting times in bitcoin land as usual
All right ret creighton. Thank you so much for being on
Yeah, thank you for having me. I really appreciate these this video series that you're doing
All right, and then I just wanted to let the guests introduce themselves a little bit Jameson
What's your background and what's your opinion on the bitcoin fork and just a really short sound bite?
Sure my background i've been a software engineer for 10 years
I've been interested in bitcoin for five been working at bitgo for two
And uh, i've really been through all sides of the block size debate
I was a big proponent of xt and classic back in the day
I I think that we're going to need bigger blocks eventually. I think that we're also going to need off-chain scaling and
At the moment though, it looks like segregated witness is going to be the safest swiftest path forward
So i'm really favoring that and hoping that we can get some larger legacy blocks before too long as well
All right ret a little bit of your background and your basic opinion on bitcoin scaling
Uh, hi, so i'm a software engineer and I uh first started using bitcoin in 2011
um
I also
Uh, as you said, i've forked uh zcash to create
The classic and i've been uh going to bitcoin developer meetups in san francisco for a few years now
I know several of the core developers. I know several people who work at block stream
Um, originally when I heard about segregated witness, um, it sounded like a great idea to me
Um sounded, you know really reasonable. Uh, I thought for sure it was going to pass
and um as I I saw we we can get more into it, you know in in detail, but
Um, the more that i've been learning about bitcoin unlimited
um, I have i've sort of
Learned that I I sort of came to understand both sides of this debate
I feel like I understand both sides of the debate really well
And just that there there are some reasons to consider bitcoin unlimited in my opinion
All right, and we've got about 50 live viewers
So if everybody could give us a thumbs up and a share so that more people could hear about this and go ahead and join
Us in the chat. I'm sure the chat's scrolling by but i'm not looking at it right now
Uh, just again to go over what is our goal tonight our goal tonight is to find agreement
What we're looking for is the places that I can get ret and Jameson to agree. We're also looking to find disagreement
We're looking to find the absolute technical points where one person says five and one person says ten and they can't come together
But we can put that aside for later and we can work on the disagreements later. So let's start with agreement
Bitcoin was invented by satoshi nakamoto
Jameson Lopp
So they claimed
ret creighton
Uh, yes
So that's pretty close to agreement bitcoin has 21 million units Jameson Lopp
Uh, except for the rounding error. We'll say that's close enough. Yeah
ret creighton
Uh, so you you say this a lot
And I can I can actually uh, i'm gonna I would I would say that right now. We're in a phase of bitcoin
where
Block reward
Is the by far the dominant? Um, the the additional reward that's given is the dominant mining fees or mining
Rewards that the miners are collecting
And it's actually unknown what's going to happen
say
in 30 40 50 years
When that's a much smaller percentage of the rewards that they collect
And there are a lot of um
So there's a lot there's just a sort of unknown answer unknown questions that we have in game theory about how that will play out
And I think that there is the there may be the case where you have to say look we in order for the
The blocks to keep being stable which is the net and keep a stable network that we all want
We need to keep subsidizing
The miners with a block reward
And honestly, we don't know if that's going to happen and it might be the case that we have to say look
We have to accept one percent two percent inflation something like that
And these are choices that could come down, you know down the road
And um, yeah as bitcoin is programmed now, I would say yes, there's this 21 million coin limit
But I would not be surprised to see
Inflation added in 50 years 100 years or whatever
So all right
I also would have accepted a disagreement that so many people have lost their bitcoins as well as minus the satoshi bitcoins
That maybe there's less than 21 million. I would also accepted that as an answer
Let's continue with our goal of agreement bitcoin is an open source project jameson
As far as I can tell there are quite a few different open source code bases for the protocol
There's probably some closed source code bases as well that we don't even know about
Let's go to ret
Yes, I completely agree with that
All right open source projects have their own forms of government or governance a way of getting things done and let's go backwards
Let's go to ret
Yep
And jameson
And jameson
In a vague hand wavy fashion, I suppose you could say that every collection organization has some form of governance
And how were things done previously under satoshi was this similar to how things are done with linux under linus?
Let's go to ret
Um
Well, so I mean I I actually wasn't really around when satoshi was still around but looking at um
old bitcoin talks
Uh, you know it appeared that there were a small number of developers
Uh, there was you know bitcoin was worth
far less than it was today and I think that so she satoshi was probably looked to
as
You know an authority figure largely by other developers and participants in in the project early on
jameson
Definitely, um, I I actually covered that in my my last article that I wrote on coin desk about really what satoshi did
In the very early days all the mistakes he made all of the things that he missed
Uh, you know how fenny being really the original
Contributor who who showed a lot of those early mistakes and edge cases with with opcodes and other bugs and uh
In the early days, it was definitely not a code is law. It was a satoshi's vision is law. That's what we're going for
And and there were mistakes in bitcoin. So bitcoin can be fallible. It's software. It needs to be improved sometimes right jameson
Definitely. I mean any of these systems are are just ways of automating
What the human consensus actually wants, you know
We're just trying to duplicate human consensus in a machine world so that it can do what we want when we're not looking
And ret and definitely I mean one of the most well-known cases was there was something like a
a bug that allowed people to
Basically, what do you call it? Uh
um
Create an extra 184 billion bitcoin and that was very quickly
patched and um and
Reversed or I don't know forked by by the miners
Out of the blockchain, so it's not in the in the chain that exists anymore
Um, but you know, definitely most people considered that a bug in bitcoin
So we're agreeing that bitcoin's open source satoshi was its leader
Uh satoshi was also not infallible there were mistakes in bitcoin bitcoin is software
And we can fix those mistakes. Sometimes we even make more mistakes when we fix them
But we're generally in all a lot of agreement there
So we're moving on towards bitcoin unlimited now bitcoin unlimited deals with the lack of satoshi problem
I believe by the system of appointing a president a president of bitcoin. Is this a good thing?
We'll just go to ret first good
Um, I don't know honestly, um, it is you know, they're
It is a little different
Um, I think so it could be a good thing or a bad thing or a good thing sometimes and probably a bad thing sometimes
um, I think it's a good thing in that if you are trying for pr and marketing if you're looking for
Maybe a person to be a representative or a spokesperson
Person, uh for bitcoin you can have an idea of maybe who to look for
It can be a good thing
maybe sometimes um in leadership when you just want to get things done and you have more ability to execute and sort of a
a top-down
Fashion, uh, it can obviously be a really bad thing
if you're
a government
That decides you want to look for someone to either
uh blame or
um, or you're looking for someone to coerce into
um putting back doors into the software and things like that, so um
You know it it I think there are good points and they're going to be bad points, but it's definitely different
It also definitely depends on the character of the president of bitcoin
Certainly, we'd hope that the person would be infallible like the pope, but we can't always count on that
We cannot even really count on that with popes
Jameson your thoughts
Well, I mean, I don't really want to speak for the bitcoin unlimited organization
but my understanding
and my hope is that uh
You know, I believe roger is currently the president of bitcoin unlimited
I I don't think that he thinks of that position as the president of bitcoin
But rather of the bitcoin unlimited organization and implementation
because even if bitcoin unlimited
Unlimited becomes the de facto reference client or what have you?
even then
Bitcoin unlimited will not have you know an authoritative control over the bitcoin protocol
The bitcoin protocol is this amorphous
hand wavy
thing that emerges from our sort of collective desires as
Developers come in and write code to sort of to codify our desires and then we choose what rules to run. So
um
I'm not i'm not really worried at all about there being a a president of bitcoin or president of a bitcoin organization
I guess from a protocol level standpoint
That's a very fair distinction. I like the ring of president of bitcoin. It sounds nice
But I also agree with ret when he said it's a place for the media to contact the media often looks for the
Ceo of bitcoin and we never seem to have one but this would give us something like that ret
Did you have more to add? Yeah, just point point of information actually roger bear is not president of bitcoin unlimited
Uh, it's a is a person named andrew clifford. I believe and i've never met him. I think um,
I think he is actually I mean
uh as far as
Um, i've never i've never been introduced to him. I've never seen him at a san francisco bitcoin developer meetup
um, so
You know, I I don't know he seems like he may not be very well known at least in the san francisco
uh bitcoin community
Well, certainly no disrespect meant to president clifford, but we got to get him on this show right away
Uh, let's get him up on twitter. Let's see if we can do that
So we've agreed that bitcoin is an open source project probably invented by satoshi nakamoto. Maybe a team
We used to have a leader. We don't have a leader
We're not sure if we want a permanent or a fixed leader in the future
But let's move on to problems with the bitcoin network. What kind of problems does bitcoin face today ret?
Uh, what kind of problem well, what kind of problems um, I
Look, and so that's you kind of caught me off guard there, right?
Because they're just like i'm gonna accept you could say too many transactions or the fees are too high
Yeah, so so okay to start there
so, um
That seems to be a big concern
right now to
um a lot of businesses and a lot of a lot of companies and and what what the bitcoin miners are asking for is to
Lower the bitcoin transaction fees and allow more people to use bitcoin
For a lower fee. So that is that's one major issue affecting businesses and users at the moment
All right. So we'll say that users are affected by high transaction fees
Uh because there's a lot of transactions that we might want to try to lower them Jameson
What would you think about this problem? Is this also agreed as a problem?
Yeah, I mean working at bitco we have had more and more user complaints of you know transactions
not confirming in a timely manner of
Transaction fee costs going through the roof
I mean we have a lot of enterprises that use us and they have seen
their their fees go up, you know over an order of magnitude over the past year and
As far as i'm aware. This hasn't quite yet reached the point where it's actually
Pricing these businesses out of their business models
But you know if if you were to draw a trajectory and assume that it continues on the same trajectory
I think some of them are starting to get worried about that. And so that is definitely creating
Challenges for us from an engineering standpoint
And this also created a problem with wallets wallets originally didn't have a variable fee
Assignment so they would maybe send a fee that's too small or they would send a fee that's too big
To try to cover themselves. This is very confusing to users. They don't really understand
I think that the fee is based upon the size of your transaction
That's just a really basic understanding. But the users probably don't even have that
They would prefer to just pay a dollar or pay a quarter
They're not sure why there's a difference
But let's we're all in agreement. There's a lot of transactions and there's a lot of fees
Okay, so how are we going to solve this problem of too many transactions and too many fees?
I'll start with Jameson this time
Sure, so, you know, there's there's multiple ways you can solve it the
The most straightforward, of course being just go in and change the block size limit so we can have bigger blocks
the the more complex
technical
and I guess
long-term
Vision would be to try to reduce the current usage of block space
via second layer payment channels and other networks
You could of course also change the block size limit
You could of course also just say well, we'll just use some other altcoin because it's a lot cheaper and
And from that standpoint you could also say no
There's actually far more than 21 million bitcoins because all these altcoins are actually like trickled down
you know from bitcoin when it gets too congested, but
It's a it's a challenging problem
And there's a lot of different ways to approach it
And of course the the different perspectives that we have between people on how they think that we should approach it is
What's causing a lot of this contention and conflict?
If they don't like it when I say the wrong company's name
They're really going to not like it if I say that all the altcoins are really bitcoins
But I like this solution so far. We have three solutions. We have bigger blocks
We have a more complicated long-term solution with segwit. We also have plan three just use an altcoin
We say that litecoin is now mini bitcoin and if you're going to buy a latte use mini bitcoin and there we go
What do you think of these? I think that was a really good explanation from Jameson
I think he pretty much covered all the bases. The only thing i'm surprised he missed a little bit is
Rather than making the blocks bigger. You could also introduce something like segwit which allows more transactions
into the same block space which is you know, another way to
Increase transactions just the probably the fourth of all the ways. I think we pretty much got all our bases covered
All right. So let's just go through these these issues one by one
The number one that he listed is bigger blocks
Now if you make the blocks bigger what i've heard is there could be an issue with the great firewall of china
There's a potential latency issue because the larger the blocks get you have to send them through that's harder
There's also issues with hard drive space. You have to have a bigger hard drive to do that
Maybe some of the miners aren't ready for that. What are the potential issues with bigger blocks?
We'll go to Jameson first and then to red
Yeah, I think there is a general consensus that at this point the the biggest bottleneck is bandwidth and latency
Network propagation issues. So, you know as a result of that you've seen things like compact blocks extra thin blocks
Matt corallo has built not one but two different high-speed blocks
A high-speed relay network specifically for miners. Of course, those are
a little bit more centralized than
I think a lot of the bitcoin developers would like but it is what it is. They they get the job done pretty well at the moment
but really at the end of the day, I think one of the the biggest points of condition contention and
differences in perspective is
What should the cost of running a full node be for a user?
and
You know, you can break that down into bandwidth cpu disk space and all this
Other stuff and come up with some fancy matrix algorithm for determining the current cost as hardware
continues to get cheaper
but
The the the question then becomes what's the actual dollar cost or you know, how much?
How much is someone going to have to invest in a full node so that they can be?
Self-sovereign in their finances and be in a fully trustless environment
And no matter where you put that dollar figure if it's fifty dollars a hundred dollars a thousand dollars
you're disenfranchising people and
Then the question then becomes how many people are we willing to disenfranchise from having those specific security properties?
That we can then enfranchise another set of people from being able to use bitcoin
so it's this weird trade-off which
unfortunately is very hard to quantify and that just makes the debates much worse because
Both sides have valid perspectives, but a lot of times you can't even really put numbers to anything
And the hardware issue is similar to the bandwidth issue
It's usually people in more developed countries that have better hardware have better bandwidth
People in less developed countries have worse hardware and worse bandwidth
Rhett, what would you think about the what we talked about the big blocks here? Yeah
I mean the the other I think Jameson made some great points
the other technical issue
that is maybe worth considering is that
Well, one one thing is that people are they're using they're using bitcoin for different purposes right now
And some people have they've been sold on this prom promise that the blockchain is immutable
Which means what does that mean? Does that mean in in 20 years and 50 years?
100 years you can just expect full notes to keep every single bitcoin transaction record ever and they'll be required to have that or
Will there be some pruning?
Uh, or you know, no, no one really knows what that what that means at this point, which kind of means that when you're
um trying to price the the storage cost
of a transaction
No one really knows are you are you pricing that in for 10 years or 100 years?
and so
Um, you know, that's another reason why why some of these these costs are just really hard to calculate
Um, you know, what what is the fair cost of a transaction fee at this point?
We also don't know if new hard drives or new bandwidth technologies will be invented
Uh, they may turn this all around it may not be an issue anymore
Also on this hard block issue or the larger block issue. Sorry, we would have to hard fork
What do you think about a hard fork? A basic understanding is that a hard fork?
Peter said it yesterday a hard fork changes the rules. I think it subtracts a rule
I'm gonna maybe be wrong, but it basically makes the chain incompatible so that the chain new coins are incompatible with old coins
It's jameson is a hard fork a good solution to get to these bigger blocks
I mean, I think that on a long enough time frame
We are going to have to make backwards incompatible changes to bitcoin
Uh for one reason or another, uh, I think actually it was ryan charles who posted something recently
About uh, you know 20 the 2038 like date time stamp problem
And it's kind of like the next y2k. I mean there could very easily be some sort of y2k type events
That requires us to make non-backwards compatible changes, but also just like I said at the very beginning
if we want bitcoin to be
the
mainstream
cryptocurrency then even with a very optimal segwit based lightning network
uh, and very optimistic, uh
uh assumptions around you know, how many transactions you would be able to do with those payment channels
If you want to onboard the entire globe, you know billions of people you are going to have to have more
uh
On-chain transactions anchored into larger blocks that then are able to use those second layer networks. So
uh the I think the real
Uh contention right now is timelines and time frames and you know, how urgent is it to do that now versus
to have the ecosystem continue to
to struggle
for another year or two or three no one is completely sure we can be optimistic or pessimistic, but uh,
I think that one way or another we we have to have every scalability solution we can get our hands on
I like this idea of urgency. I think we should talk about this more later
But ret your thoughts on a hard fork
Um, yeah, so it's it's that's a really important point. Um
So the first thing is I I think that if you ask peter todd
he'll say that
bitcoin has hard forked once
And and that was early in the history of bitcoin when it switched from I believe the fork was switching from
uh following choosing the chain with most blocks
Versus choosing the chain with the most total work
and and really everybody at the time just
um
Actually forked it wasn't contentious
And um, and so and there was there was no there's not a separate chain
now
Vitalik buterin actually did a really good write-up with this kind of this venn diagram
um describing sort of
Different kinds of hard and soft forks and I think that's one point where um
people get into a lot of arguments because two people are arguing about
What a hard hard fork is and they each in their mind have a sort of a different definition of of what a hard fork is
and
um, I
I'm not going to be able to rattle them off off the top of my head
You can look look through look at the venn diagram and they they sort of mean different things but
um the
the scary thing
about um a hard fork, um
I think or the most risky thing is that if if you have
two groups of people or two
networks that decide at that point that they're going to split like we had with ethereum and ethereum classic
and
um, you know that was a case where
uh right now, I don't know ethereum classic is maybe
five or you know, 10 percent
uh the the market cap and usage of um
ethereum
So you kind of have this like majority and minority fork the network splits and they just keep on going forever
um, so yeah, that's I guess sort of those are my big my basic thoughts
Okay, so we're what we're agreeing on hard forks is there's different kind of hard forks. There's
There's contentious hard forks like the ethereum ethereum classic hard fork where we end up with two chains
And there's basically just a lot of confusion
Then there's hard forks like we had a bitcoin problem and everyone agreed to hard fork and surprisingly
Everyone got on board and joined the new chain and there's no one fighting out that old chain
Uh, so we're agreeing on that
What was else I gonna say?
Something else about hard forks. Anyway, let's just move on to um the layer two solution. We're talking about
Is it possible should we go to a lightning type solution where there's a second layer network on top of bitcoin?
Would that solve our problem to start with ret and then go to james?
Um, so I guess what I want to say about that is um, first of all, I know the
Um joseph and and tash and elizabeth and rosebeth the the developers and creators of the lightning network really well
um, they
Have done really great work on um lightning network. They have
Spent a really long time developing it and asking the community for feedback
Um, and and so I think that they are doing really great things
um
what um
I guess
I guess sort of what I kind of disagree with or what I hear I hear a lot of people
That kind of they I feel like they're misinformed because they know that there's this transaction malleability
Bug in bitcoin right now, which is preventing
Uh the lightning network from from us being able to use the lightning network on main bitcoin. However
Uh, it is possible to use the lightning network on segwit
activated
Uh testnet right now and that's the main way that they're testing lightning network
And um, I will say that I so the lightning network just had a new release a few days ago
um, I
Used the release prior to that
And it was extremely difficult for me
To send my first lightning network transaction. I mean, I know it's really early stages
But um, i'm a developer it took me
Like about four hours of working on it. I had to ping
Uh their developer they had a they have a faucet and it was it was down
I mean, these are all like issues that are solvable
But I I think that if people are thinking that oh once we activate segwit, it's transaction malleability
boom
Uh lightning network is this switch that's going to turn on I I don't think that's the case
So I I view lightning network
As um something that that made it will likely develop
And be used
Uh more and more but I see that as maybe
something
Two years down the road, maybe you know, it could it's we're really just not there yet
All right, also I remembered my third point on hard forks
I was going to say that we're basically in agreement if there's a y2k type bug in the future
A time stamping issue that we would hard fork together as a group to fix that
Uh, it's very unlikely. I think that we would hard fork over a y2k time stamp issue and end up with two chains
So so actually what I would I would say on that point, um
quantum computing
is really going to be a big deal because
Uh, if we get to the point where we all know that rsa, uh, is going to be broken then you're you're going to either have to move your
Bitcoin to a new public private key system or you're going to lose your bitcoin, right?
And it'll be really interesting to see if the toshi moves his bitcoin
Then um, but I you know, I think I mean what there's not going to be a choice at that point, right?
Like that's an inevitability in all crypto systems that they will become obsolete and you'll need to migrate. Yeah
And then jameson, would you basically be in agreement that we would hard fork together to fix a time stamp issue?
Just to use the hard fork. I I seriously doubt that that would be contentious. Yeah
All right. Excellent and to move on to the lightning network. Do you agree with red is lightning not ready?
And also while we're talking about lightning, what would it do to the miners fees? Can the miners survive a lightning network? And i'll ask red
Right. Uh, well, I mean, you know lightning is definitely not ready now
Uh, how long will it be before there are you know user facing lightning wallets that you know successfully abstract away all the complexities?
And make it as simple if not simpler as using a bitcoin wallet these days. I mean, I would be optimistic maybe in a year
um
But also it may not be
That lightning gets traction from that standpoint. Um
You know it there are so many other use cases that there might pop up first such as you know
Machine to machine micro payments internet of things is something that i'm seeing a lot of
Even larger companies starting to work on these days
And it's also possible that we'll really see it more
Start as a back-end infrastructure where uh, you know, it would not surprise me if it really does start off as more of a hub and spoke type thing where
Where you've got the large liquidity providers of wallets and other services around the ecosystem
Who are able to jump in and and use their technical capabilities to
To hop on to the lightning network possibly before we even have, you know user facing, uh, ui wallets and then they're using the lightning network to
You know do these off-chain transactions between each other in a trustless fashion. I mean there's
It's very hard to speculate as to how uh
Unknown technology like this is really going to take off in a very very very very very very very very very very very very
A lot of technology like this is really going to take off and and it it may not even be that it's just the lightning network
So, you know, once again going back and looking at ryan charles
He's building his own, you know micropayments, uh hub and spoke system and it's not the lightning network and uh, it doesn't even require segwit
And he probably won't be the only one to do that
Uh, if we continue to have more and more challenges with the limitations of block space that just
Creates pressure
Economic pressure on all of these companies to come up with their own solutions
Permissionless solutions where they don't have to go out and try to lobby miners or lobby the rest of the ecosystem
They're they're going to want to build
Their own systems that will work without having to rely upon other people changing stuff. So, uh, I think
I'm really parroting a lot of the stuff that jimmy song has been writing about in some of his medium posts that are
Really my style of thinking very optimistic of like, you know things might look terrible right now
But it's just challenges for us to overcome
So we may see many interlocking walled gardens of micropayments
That's an interesting idea, right? I and I think back to that
um, I just this is sort of one of the I guess one of the things that um,
I don't know. I think this is a really important point
That a lot of people
um, you know lightning network sounds like it it will be this this great thing
and um a lot of people just in their head, it's just oh like lightning network will solve things and it sounds really great
but
It so it will actually change
the user experience
very much
Because for example, if you think about like if you were, you know right now
Uh, I don't know you sign up for coinbase
And you get some bitcoin, right? Well now what's happening is um
So there's a few things. I mean you have this extra layer that somehow needs to be
Uh developed for and you know this this opening up channels on the lightning network
And then you have this complication that actually
Every time you open up a channel. It's costly. It costs a transaction fee
And when the lightning network was presenting this in the early days, that was pretty much their risk
They were saying like yeah, you know
So like worst case is you're trusting the other party enough that you might lose a transaction fee
And every time you open and close a new channel, you know, okay, it costs you a transaction fee
Which didn't sound like much back then
But if we're talking about transact or transaction fees are like ten dollars
Or two dollars or you know, whatever
Um now every time even if it's one dollar
If if you are opening up a channel every month
Now every single one of your users is are costing you a dollar a month in a transaction fee to open up this channel
Now and that just changes things dramatically and yeah, you know, who knows is it going to go to one dollar?
Is it going to go to ten dollars?
Are we going to require coinbase to be opening up a channel every every month for ten dollars for each of their users?
And if you try to say well, let's stretch that out to a year
right then the whole
trustlessness of of lightning network kind of breaks down
Because now your bitcoin is locked up for a year
right, so
It's not just this like this magic thing
That makes you get a lot of transactions for free
And I think that um, you know, I just hear a lot of people
Thinking that like lightning network is going to come and solve all their problems and a
Almost none of those people that I've talked to you have actually sent a lightning network transaction
So what I would say is that if you think lightning network is
Going to like solve all the problems of bitcoin, then please go and try lightning network
And if you think that there are any like issues with it
And maybe you could contribute to like that would be great like help help make lightning network better
Um, but I think that you know, people should just be forming should have an informed
Point of view when they're when they're forming these opinions about lightning network
So all right Jameson your thoughts are the transaction fees too high?
The transaction fees too high for the lightning network
Yeah, I mean, um
I
Wrote an incredibly long article about a year ago about all of the potential complexities and challenges that I saw
that we're going to have to overcome with the lightning network
and uh both at like the micro
payment channel scale and the macro, you know network mesh scale
And uh, there's still a lot of unknowns where you know, i've talked to a number of the lightning devs and it's uh,
You know, you can't predict the future. It's we're we're gonna have to build it see what happens if stuff breaks adjust
Um, that's kind of why you're seeing a lot of these lightning developers take a very conservative approach to what they're building where
Like right now, I believe they actually are limiting the value of any given channel to about 40 dollars worth
so
you know if that was like the permanent like you can never have a channel more than 40 dollars worth ever in lightning and and we
Have you know on chain transaction fees that are becoming one dollar two dollar three dollars
Then yeah, it starts to sound kind of dumb and not really economically feasible
Um, but really at the moment that's more of a safety
issue
um
In terms of I guess one of the things that I find really interesting is that the whole argument about locking up your bitcoins
and
It's true that you know, you you are encumbering your bitcoins in this multi-signature transaction
So that you can't spin them in another on chain transaction because that would be conflicting with it
But the idea of them being locked up in terms of capital
I think only really makes sense like during the initial bootstrapping phase of lightning
So if you're envisioning a future where the vast majority of transactions
The vast majority of transactions are in fact occurring on the lightning network
Then you're not really locking up your money. You're just moving it to another layer and you you know
If you're paying and receiving the vast majority of people on the lightning network
Then I don't think you would really consider your money locked up
But of course, this is all speculation on what the future use cases of on chain versus off chain transactions would be
And we could speculate all night long about what what could happen
So so just on that point when I was when I was talking about I guess locking it up. Um
so yeah, if lightning if if
who your um who you've created if
Who you've created your lightning channel with is a trustworthy person and everything works fine
um, then then it doesn't it well shouldn't feel like you've locked it up because every time
You want to send a transaction back and forth?
You'll all just you'll do that voluntarily and nothing will happen. The whole point of a lightning network
Is that you don't have to trust people the the person that you created this channel with and if that person decides hey
I'm gonna just try to hold your bitcoin hostage
Right. Well, the very worst case is at the end of this end time lock
you just get your bitcoin back and originally when when lightning network was um,
Uh presented at the bitcoin developer meetup. You know, there were discussions of like well
How long should end time and lock time be and they were like, well it could be maybe it'll be a week
Maybe it'll be two weeks. So, you know worst case you'll get your bitcoin back in two weeks
Now if we start saying that okay these terms that transaction fees are so high
And we don't want to create a new channel every two weeks and instead we're going to create a channel once a year
Now I believe that you you might
Be under this risk where it could be the person you've created a channel with can start to hold your coins hostage
And they could say no, you know, actually i'm just gonna
I'm not i'm not gonna sign these um transactions you want me to sign
And if you don't like it your bitcoin can stay frozen for a year
And that now there's some real opportunity costs that you're losing
On bitcoin that's frozen for a year and it kind of in a way it starts fighting against
The trustlessness of lightning, right? Yeah. Um, now I believe that one of the responses to that was to use
Relative lock time so that you could basically set like one or two weeks and then push it back
You know every time you update the payment channel
But I think a lot once again, you know, this is just like a lot of numbers and and uh
Back of the napkin calculations where we're just pulling numbers out of nowhere
And I think the idea is that they're gonna they're gonna throw
These magic numbers into their, you know test
Networks see what happens. Uh, let the network grow a little bit more see what happens
Especially if you talk to rusty russell he'll he'll straight up tell you I expect for there to be complete
Failures and collapses in the early days of lightning network because it's going to be a learning experience. So
You know, hopefully
With enough
Experience and time and seeing people trying to act as malicious lightning nodes
Trying to exploit each other, you know, basically being cypher punks, you know
trying to find all of those edge cases those problems then
Use the old sewer rat analogy from andreas, you know
Eventually, we will overcome all the viruses and we'll become stronger and you know learn from our experiences
So it's uh, I guess kind of optimistic versus
Pessimistic view of you know, how great is this mountain that we have to scale?
So i'm actually hearing a lot of agreement on litecoin
We're agreeing that are on lightning network that lightning network is an interesting project lightning network is not ready yet
There are a lot of unknowns and we may even need bigger channels
So that's a whole nother potential argument and debate there
But I just want to go through one issue again because I want to cover all three groups
The coders the users and the miners is there room for the miners in the lightning network?
Will they still make money from bitcoin? Can they make money by being part of the lightning?
Telephone chain of transactions. I'll start with Jameson. They will go to red
Yeah
Though I think that
They would probably benefit more if there were in fact smaller blocks and you know scarcer block space
Uh, this is one of the things that I speculated about in that article that I wrote
Basically think of it as it's trickle-down economics of of off-chain to on-chain
So if we do end up having a very very popular mainstream lightning network
With a lot of value held in that
Then there's going to have to be high value
On-chain anchor transactions, which people would
Economically, you know be incentivized to pay much higher fees even than today probably to open
But of course, they're not going to do that if you can only put forty dollars in a channel
I'm thinking more like if we get to the point where lightning is so
Well tested and proven and robust that you would be willing to put a thousand dollars into a channel
And that is like the most effective way to do that
If you put a thousand dollars into a channel and that is like your primary wallet that you walk around with for a year
Then sure, you know spend ten dollars
on a crazy on-chain fee because you're going to be saving it down the road, but
Lots of hand waving once again of what uh possible situations could happen
All right ret your thoughts
Um, yeah, I mean I I can tell you as a bitcoin blockchain consultant for the past few years
Um, a lot of people are excited to anchor all sorts of metadata in the bitcoin blockchain
um, I I see lightning channels as just
Another kind of uh metadata layer that people want to anchor in the bitcoin blockchain. There's
There's increasing demand to anchor
Uh data in the bitcoin blockchain and the lightning network will just increase that demand
Okay, our third potential problem and solution we came up with was using another coin such as example
Litecoin to do all of our smaller transactions while continuing to use bitcoin for our larger transactions
Ret, what do you think about this possible solution?
Um, people are doing that I think people are doing that and I think that that's actually I I would say
That is one of the reasons why
um
I I I think value is leaving bitcoin
And that is one of the one of the biggest reasons why I can understand
uh and um
I guess what's what's the word but I I understand the the argument that roger vera is making and that bitcoin unlimited is making and
And what some of these miners are worried about and I believe
That what what they're worried about is they're very invested in bitcoin and the future of bitcoin
and when you see
um a lot of applications now are being built on the ethereum network because it's a it's a penny a transaction and
Your transaction will go through in in 17 seconds
And a lot of developers like myself
Um, you know when when you look for okay
Um, I just want to make this application that works and and this is the big problem is I'll I use that word works
And and then a lot of people who are just holding bitcoin like gold like a store of value
They'll say well bitcoin works for me
Right, but I I can tell you that there if there are a lot of applications that are really innovative that people want to um,
You know build these really great products and they're moving to ethereum
Because they have 17 second transactions that cost a penny and if you look at the market cap of ethereum
Uh, it's it's it's come back down. I don't know where it is between three and four billion dollars
But it was um, you know a billion dollars a couple years ago
Um, and it's it's grown to you know, three billion and I think it I don't know
I forget the relative numbers, but ethereum has grown a whole lot quicker than bitcoin
um, so
uh, yeah
I would agree red that the uh system that works
Is not always the best system the safest thing I can do with my computer is turn it off take the battery out and put it
In the closet. It's very secure. It's not going to get hacked. It doesn't go on any wi-fi networks
But it's not very useful to me as a computer
I've also i've heard what you're saying about i've seen rogers tweets that bitcoin is losing market share and he's presenting this as a big problem
I would propose another way of looking at it the way that we've been discussing tonight
Is that maybe bitcoin is a steam boiler and this is we're pulling the the the whistle
And the steam is coming off the boiler preventing it from exploding
Maybe these altcoins are preventing bitcoin from exploding and this isn't a bad thing bitcoin doesn't necessarily need 100% of the market share
This might be a different way of looking at things, but I think we need to explore this as an idea as well
Jameson your thoughts on using an altcoin to scale bitcoin?
Yeah, well, I mean, I think the the question is, you know, what are we engineering bitcoin to do and
I can't think of of any like protocol level developer that i've met who has ever said, you know
We're engineering bitcoin to be worth, you know a market cap. That's a hundred times what it is today and we're going to do that
By x y and z man
Maybe maybe we can get that guy. Maybe he's a vet. Uh, you know, that's I think really more of a like a ceo enterprise mindset of of growth
Uh in terms of of financial value
Whereas, you know most of the protocol developers that I interact with they care more about things like uh security and privacy and trustlessness and permissionlessness
And all of the the buzzwords that we're very familiar with so I think that's also where you get another big point of contention
Especially between the enterprises and the the developers because they don't necessarily have the exact same economic interests
All right, and our fourth point tonight right there more on that or oh yeah, I was just going to say
Um, that's interesting that you point out that that you haven't really heard a lot of developers. Um, you know talk about bitcoin reaching some kind of market cap
Because I I think that's that's what I see a lot of investors and holders and if you go on reddit
I mean very often times over the years. I mean, that's that's why people
That's what brings a lot of people to bitcoin
That's what I think a lot of the why a lot of the users are really interested in bitcoin
is because they do see bitcoin as as
Replacing the dollar or replacing gold and they talk about what's what's the market cap of bitcoin going to be
When it replaces the point of gold and I hear tone days all the time. He says gold is obsolete
Because the metal detector got invented and I can have 12 words in my head and I can walk across a border with a million dollars in bitcoin
And so it's better than bitcoin and i've heard venture capitalists say like, you know, are you kidding? This is definitely
The future of money and and and they're talking about like when we're going to colonize space
And stuff and they're they're like, they're like, yeah, we're not going to like what are we going to ship dollars to space?
Right, like that's stupid and and so
You know, I I hear a lot of people say
I mean, that's why I think a lot of people are in this space and I agree. I I hear a lot of developers are scared
to make a mistake with a with a something that's worth 20 billion dollars and they want
They they want to be um
They want to be risk, um tolerant. They they they want to be intelligent. They want to be secure
They want to be prudent and you don't nobody wants to be a risk-tolerant
Sure, they want to be prudent and you don't nobody wants to be the developer that like lost 20 billion dollars in bitcoin or whatever
And nobody wants to be market pellets and make the exchange that everything breaks, right?
um
but I
that's
That's a that's attractive to me about bitcoin. I do see a lot of potential for the future. Um
um replacement of money in bitcoin and and um
And I think it's kind of sad if if what if what we're agreeing to is that if we want to be
invested in cryptocurrencies
That what we need to do is actually start divesting into these other altcoins that maybe have faster
or um, or you know better technology for certain use cases
and
um, you know if if that's the case, I mean that's
Uh, I I think that bitcoin has the best brand globally right now
I mean those those like bit flyer commercials in japan, you know are awesome
You've got you got people all over the world. They know about bitcoin
and if if if we're not going to innovate
with with the
Position that bitcoin has in the marketplace right now, then it's just throwing away a lot of value
Well, first I want to say it would be a shame to see a palette full of greenbacks go out the airlock into space
That would be a very sad loss of money. Red's got a good point there on the space-based money
I also want to say that this is part of the bitcoin governance problem
What i'm seeing is that we have three different groups of people we have miners
We have users and we have coders and they each have different problems
They have different goals and they're all working together on this system
And they're all working together on this system that we call bitcoin
So part of what we're doing is we're trying to get all three of these groups onto one page
And to make sure that some don't collude with others against the others and that we have
All kinds of complicated political power issues that we're dealing with there
Well, let's move on to our fourth problem and solution for bitcoin scaling which was segregated witness Jameson
We're going to go to you first. Maybe give us a little uh
Round up of what segregated witness is and what problems it would solve or potentially solve sure. So
segregated witness
Basically is doing exactly what it says it is
It is segregating the the witness which in this case is essentially the the transaction signature
So we're taking that signature out of where it currently is in the bitcoin blocks
And we're just moving it over a little bit so that uh older nodes
Don't see that
But newer nodes do see it. So
This is one of the big points of contention of is segregated witness a block size increase and well, uh from the legacy standpoint
No, it's just freeing up more space for other transaction data
From the new perspective of the segwit block format. Then yes, the the serialized block is actually larger
but I think that
that whole block size increase really gets lost in the noise of all this debate because
That was never the primary reason why segregated witness was sought after by the developers
They were seeking to fix the transaction malleability problem, which peter willa has been trying to do
For as long as he's been in bitcoin and he had a bip open for a number of years
Which eventually he just gave up on he was like, nope won't fix
And uh, but thankfully they figured out how to do segwit as a soft fork and have been pursuing that
But so, you know the real value add of fixing transaction malleability is enabling these second layer networks like
lightning network or at least making it easier to enable them and uh
and it's also got some other benefits, I believe like the
uh bit nine
Will allow us to
Have like many many multiple parallel, uh soft forks going on at the same time
Um opens up the door for other things like schnorz sigs, which you could very well argue is on chain scaling
signature aggregation
so it's uh
It's really bitcoin core's answer to to how do we make bitcoin more performant while
Doing it in a backwards compatible format
All right ret your thoughts on segregated witness
Um, yeah, I thought that was that was a really good technical explanation of what's segregated witness is. Um
Um my so my thoughts on segregated witness, um
I I have no
problem with segregated witness from a technical point of view and um
I was actually really excited for segregated witness when when I used to go to bitcoin developer meetups
and I actually was was there at a meetup right around the time when they
Uh four months ago and when they were pushing segregated witness out and I asked peter willa. I was like, oh, that's awesome
Um, you know, then we can start using lightning. It's gonna be great
Um, you know, how long do you think it's gonna take to activate?
And and he was like, oh
He he conservatively he said because after they get to 95 percent then it's like
I don't know how many more blocks but he was like, oh, you know six months or something and
um
And I so I guess my issue
with segregated witness
Is really just um, you know, it is political and from a marketing
uh perspective
It really concerns me, you know when I see now four months later
That it's signaling maybe in the in the mid 20 percent
Uh from the miners. So what that tells me is that
That the the miners don't really want it. I mean at least they're not signaling that they want it and
Something there there was some kind of miscommunication
Between the developers and the miners because the miners the developers were so confident that there'd be no problem and no issue in getting this
Passed that they put the activation threshold at 95
95 percent so I mean at this point I I would have to I I almost would have to say like why are we even talking
about segregated witness
because
Segregated witness is just it's dead
It cannot activate this year. It's going to stay it stay out there and it's going to maybe maybe it'll get 25
Percent, maybe it'll get 75 percent
But it's not going to reach the 95 activation level. We know that
So, I mean, it's almost like
I don't even know why anyone is talking about segregated witness anymore
um
and you know, I
I what the what really brought me into
Um looking at bitcoin unlimited from the beginning
Is as I said, wait a second, like why why is it? Why are my why is it only 26?
It's not like it's 75 percent of miners and there's just like this one pool. No one likes or something, right?
It's all
75 percent of miners are not signaling that they want segregated witness and now what we're seeing is
upwards of 40 percent of miners are signaling we want bitcoin unlimited
And so we're going to cross this 51 percent
Threshold with bitcoin unlimited soon. And by the way, there's no set activation threshold for bitcoin unlimited
so
um, you know, I I think that from a technology point of view, um,
I've talked to other other bitcoin unlimited members. Um, they nobody's against
Uh the possibility of adding segregated witness or something like it
Into bitcoin unlimited down the road
Um, I don't think i've really heard
uh, you know too many
Definitive technical reasons that there's anything wrong with with segregated witness now
Well, I guess the only other thing I guess I I should point out from a
From a I don't know an organizational point of view
I think that what what worries me is because segregated witness is a soft fork
right
if we
Create this sort of major change in bitcoin with a soft fork
I worry a lot that that um psychologically the public
Is going to think oh only soft forks are safe
From here on out
And now we're talking about like five ten years down the road
Right, and we're talking like you're saying with the with the time stamp error and all these things
We're like we may very much need to hard fork bitcoin
If we impress on the public now that the only safe fork in bitcoin is a soft fork
Right, then that could be setting a bad precedent
for future growth
and development in bitcoin
so
That's where I I can be inclined to understand and you know start to think about okay
What is the point of view of these?
42 percent of miners or whatever that are that are signaling we want bitcoin unlimited, right? And maybe what they're saying is
Well, I you know, we looked at the ethereum classic the ethereum fork. Yes, they they broke off
They broke off, but now look at how much ethereum's market cap has grown
so maybe maybe fork hard forking splitting the community and innovating is actually
better off from a from a
um market cap point of view of of the people who are invested invested in bitcoin, maybe hard forking can
Lead to a more innovative innovative
um technology driven bitcoin in the future
All right. I'm seeing a lot of contentious issues there. I want to unpack some of them first
I'm seeing kind of a failed rollout of segwit segwit. It's kind of like the new
American health care act they say it's going to pass and then everyone says it's dead on arrival
So you have this bill that's kind of languishing out there at 25 percent and I can huff and puff all I want
But 25 to 95 is a big jump. I'm going to need 70 percent of the miners
Maybe I need to change the name of segwit. Maybe I need to relaunch it put it in a new package
Something like that could just be it's not going down right then
There's also the question of mining incentives are the miners incentivized to do segwit as the transactions as there's more
Transactions and the fees get higher the miners make more money
Maybe they don't want to do segwit and then there's ret's third point
Which is if we don't hard fork and if we only do soft forks
We lose the hard fork as a tool. Jameson, what do you think about each of these points and just we'll go through them slowly
Right. Yeah, so
I think one of the tricky things especially with the
History of rolling out soft forks in the way that they have been at least for the past few years
Is that a lot of the community has come to see the miner signaling as some sort of voting, you know democracy
And I think that Shaolin Frye and his emails to the dev list
Did a really good job of explaining how like we should actually be striving for
De-politicizing this entire process and instead seeking for
signaling
permissionless
activation, so
Really?
The reason why these 95 percent thresholds have been set so high was the the reason
is that
Whoever has not, you know opted into a soft fork
As a miner could conceivably get accidentally forked off of the network and we want to avoid
You know hurting the miners by doing that. So as a result, we require a really high activation threshold
But then Shaolin Frye comes along with this concept of user activated soft forks where he's saying well actually
There is a safe way
To have a minority hash rate to be validating a soft fork rule set
and
Basically the way that you would be able to do that is you would have to get the miners who don't want to validate it
Who don't particularly agree with it or want to use the soft fork to firewall off
Their older nodes that don't support it to prevent them from accidentally
validating invalid transactions according to those rules and
This does get a bit more hand wavy because now instead of talking about this very easy to read metric of you know
Signal blocks and hash rate. We're instead saying no, we're gonna try to hand wave, you know measure the economic
Majority of what you know
The nodes are who are going to be actually making use of this method
are who are going to be actually making use of this mechanism
I think that
It could probably be better thought out and be
More safe than than the current form is which is why I think you don't see a whole lot
of developers support for it
Really pushing for that to happen
but
In general, I think that the big thing to get past is that
You know bitcoin is not really a democracy
Uh, it it is this crypto anarchist system
and
It's certainly possible to turn it into a democracy or to at least
Take a segment of the ecosystem and democratize it by creating some organization that people are opting into and saying yes
We want these things
But I suspect that if that happens that you will have this contingent of hardline
Crypto-anarchists and libertarians who say no, we don't really want that because if we wanted that we could use some other legacy
uh financial system, so
It really seems to be more of a uh, philosophical than a technical problem to me though
It very well could also be economic and you know miners may not feel like they really have any incentive
Uh to to start validating those rules
But i'm not a miner. I don't pretend to speak for them
All right ret follow-up question user authenticated soft fork. Yeah the or the um
So I I would have to group so this user-activated soft fork
That was an idea that was kind of floated around reddit for about a day
Um, I I think it's absolutely. I mean, I I just have to file that again under under segwit as just
Not going to happen. I don't think anyone's really taking this user-activated soft fork
Seriously anymore. It's it's just it can't happen. Uh, you you can't
You can't like think about what would happen with 75 percent of miners opposing
This change to what you're gonna lose. You're gonna be okay with uh, the nodes like
Activating we're gonna just cut out 75 percent of the miners and oh by the way, there's also like all these other
There's roger bear and all these other businesses part of the mining community
That they have to get on board. It's not going to happen. I don't think anyone's taking
This user-activated soft fork thing. Seriously. It was like kind of a neat idea for a day and you know
It was interesting from a technology perspective to think about what could happen now
But on to jameson's other point what I do agree with
I think this is a really good point and it's the only way
That this even this 95 threshold thing makes any sense at all when i'm trying to figure out what's going to happen
At all when i'm trying to figure out how the heck why did that happen?
And I think that in the past
um bitcoin was not as political and and
This signaling mechanism was not meant to be a political mechanism
For people to vote and to make bitcoin more political
I think the intent from a developer's point of view of this signaling was really just to say look
Here's the upgrade and let's just track who has the upgrade you're going to upgrade to bitcoin
But some people are going to be slow
And if they haven't upgraded like we can have a way to see who it is and we can remind them and you know
like like a friendly kind of
Upgrade monitor system. I think was the intent
And and what it's really turned into
Is it has turned into a political voting mechanism?
And bitcoin has gotten a very political in many ways over the past few months, especially
over this issue
and um, you know what I I think what I my point of view about that
Is I think you have to be realistic and say look
This is something with a 20 billion dollar market cap that people are trying to disrupt
Uh the global financial system with of course, it's going to be political
I I think you can't you can't just say look. Let's not make bitcoin political
it's like that's just not the world that we live in and so, um, I I you know, I
I can like very much agree with Jameson and it's a shame
that the community is split now and that things have gotten political and
Um, you know politics makes people say and do stupid things
definitely
Um, and you know, it was nicer when we were all cohesive, but I I just think you have to be realistic about some of these things
All right, Jameson, would you agree the signaling has gotten too political?
Yes, um
This is a point that I think i've also been making a lot recently is that if we want to make forward progress
We have to collaborate
because just the way that the entire
Their checks and balances of power in the system are set up
Whenever one group pisses off another group or whenever one group
makes another group feel threatened or feel as if
They are becoming an authority or becoming coercive
Then the group that feels threatened or victimized or hurt or whatever
immediately bands together and digs in their heels
and the result of that is stagnation and
The status quo so like the most powerful thing in bitcoin
From the hand wavy like meat space consensus of what is bitcoin is the status quo?
And if you want to change
anything about bitcoin then you need to either figure out how to convince a
large majority of the system to come along with you with these changes or you have to figure out a way to implement the changes so that
Nobody else even cares that you're doing them and that's like the permissionless innovation style
Some excellent points and again the user activated soft fork
Versus the miners signaling brings up the point that we have three disparate groups in bitcoin
We have the users the coders and the miners and they all want different things
And they all want different things and part of this scaling problem is that we don't exactly have everyone on the same page
We kind of have some some coders going with the miners. We have the users on the other side
We have some users going with the coders, but the miners on the other side
We're having trouble getting the three sides of this pyramid together. So I want to go on to the last issue tonight
Which is the issue that we talked about earlier the issue of urgency
How urgent are these problems to bitcoin? Do we need a hard fork tomorrow?
Do we need a hard fork next week or do we need a hard fork several months or maybe a year down the road?
I'm going to go with Rhett first and then James
Um, well I can say that um
So a lot of a lot of my friends and a lot of people a lot of people who are
I'd say bitcoin core supporters
One of the things that attracts them, maybe maybe the things that attracts them to bitcoin is the long-term stability of bitcoin
And especially, you know compared to other cryptocurrencies. It's often seen as a safe haven
And so, um, there is this idea that we should not rush
Um into any any changes and I I know some people who say
You know, let's wait two years
You know, let's wait two years
Let's leave things how they are and wait two years and fees can go up to ten dollars
And and i've heard people say let's just wait until I don't I don't believe this could happen
But people are saying like let's just wait until uh, it's no longer political, right?
Let's just wait it out and you know, it could take years and even even you know, peter todd
Will say things like oh well if bitcoin unlimited splits from from bitcoin core
And then there's only the mining power splits and there's only a block every
Now there's only a block every hour on bitcoin core coin and it's full. Who cares if that takes
Two months or whatever and you have to wait for difficulty to readjust right like there a lot of a lot of
Conservative developers are of the mindset of like we can wait we can wait years
Um from my point of view, I don't know
I look I think this bitcoin is very comparable to a tech startup and I view people who own bitcoin
bitcoin in a very similar way to owning shares of a
exponentially growing technical startup
and
In my own in the past. I I don't know if people remember but
Friendster was one of the examples of like this the startup that was like growing really quickly. It was it was a
an early social network before
facebook
And um, what happened was eventually they just hit the scaling issue
And it got to be the point like if you wanted to use friendster
You'd be waiting like minutes for pages to load and it was just this like horrible experience
and they couldn't get any new users on board and you know, it lasted a few months and then people moved on to myspace and
Um, you know if you look alternatively say to twitter. Well when twitter was growing
Um, you know, they had all of these like the fail whale and they they have all these bugs
And and things and you know, you think things would happen, but there weren't like month-long periods where it was just like
You know twitter was taking like 10 minutes to load
Or whatever there wasn't like this period where you just you just couldn't use twitter that lasted really long and I think that that's critical
To the growth of a um of a fast-growing tech startup. So I would say
uh
That if if you know if what you want to do
Is bring 10 times the current the current bitcoin users if you want to increase that number by a factor of 10
Then doing something about scaling. Uh, it's really critical to do that
now
Uh, because you know if you wait a few months, there's there's all these altcoins. There's all these ico's popping up
um, the the longer you wait the more of those are going to come up and just
take market share away from bitcoin
and um
And it creates a huge risk of I I mean I saw I don't know what it's at now
But you know bitcoin had been about 80 85 90 percent of the market share of um crypto coins for a long time
I saw it drop down to 72 73 percent
um, so I think that we're at a risk of it no longer being the majority market share of crypto coins in
within a few months if um if the scaling issue isn't addressed
All right, Jameson your thoughts on urgency
Well, I think that one way or another bitcoin is still going to exist the the question becomes you know
What will it be?
and uh
one of my speculations
That uh, I really came out from the the latest satoshi roundtable with from talking to all the different people all their different perspectives
was that
Even if we end up with status quo deadlock where nothing happens
Bitcoin still keeps running
It's just the nature of bitcoin changes
The the nature I think would continue to
Go up into higher higher value amounts be more of a digital gold rather than a payment system
uh, you know potentially even getting more of the the wall street and uh traditional financial industry and uh,
You know very wealthy family back office people using it as some sort of hedge
Some sort of hedge, uh where you know, they're they're moving millions of dollars around and they don't care about a hundred dollars fee here there
so
I mean i'm optimistic that bitcoin will exist
Uh, it's it's very hard to predict the future about you know, who will win in in one thing or another
Um, i'm not so sure that you know, even if if we switch to like 10 megabyte block sizes right now today
That still wouldn't give bitcoin more capacity than say
The next top 10 altcoins, right if you're looking at that like trickle down altcoin blow off valve type thing
um
and
Also, I believe there are some altcoins that that have you know, basically unlimited block sizes, right?
Like doesn't monero have an adaptive block size limit. I think there was a pretty cool blog post a while ago
Where they they got a pretty crazy spam attack in their block sizes shot up for a while and then eventually went back down
um
I don't know. I mean bitcoin is going to scale. Uh, it's going to fail to scale
You pull some more andreas quotes out there. It'll continue to fail to scale like the internet. It's going to hurt
People are gonna, you know wish that the changes happened earlier than than they have been happening
um, but at the end of the day, it's uh, I think
We really hit on another philosophical difference of like the very conservative developers versus the more growth oriented, you know, silicon valley
startup type mindset and
the question will really come down to like
Are those philosophical differences?
Irreconcilable and if so, then you know, maybe there will be a a bitcoin fork and chain splitting, um, you know similar
So what happened with ethereum and there's no there's no way that we can stop that
I mean, it's a mechanism that is built into the protocol itself where anyone is free to exit at any time and create their own new
Rule set and and see how many other people will follow them along
All right, and my final question tonight
Is about the direction of this show who should I interview or talk to next about scaling bitcoin ret?
I stumped him on this one. He's not even unmuting himself. We're going to go to ret first
Who should I talk to next on on scaling?
Uh, I think I think these have been great shows. Um
I i'm excited for you to um, interview
Roger vera again with some follow-up questions. I would ask the uh, the audience. I know you've you've sort of solicited people to
um to
Ask some more follow-up questions. I think um, that would be great to try to sort of
drill him with some maybe some tougher questions and um
and
Um, you know, I would like to see some people from lightning network on i'd like to hear their point of view about what?
you know what they see as the um, um
So in sort of the you know, the future because we're kind of uncertain about that. We don't know whether you know after
um
Malibility sticks if we really see it rolling out to consumers in a year or two years and
Really what the economic impact and the and the transaction scaling impact would be
All right, Jameson your thoughts. Who should we have on next?
Yeah, so, you know, I see three primary
uh perspectives here where you've got the you know on on chain scale all the things versus the off chain scale all the things
And then perhaps the missing piece is the the status quo of neither
You know how how does bitcoin scale if if the block size stays the same and we don't fix transaction
Malibility and we don't have you know, a
Protocol upgrades what will happen if people are forced to innovate, you know outside of changing the protocol
That'd be interesting, but who would be an expert on that that sounds incredibly difficult. Yeah, well
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I I was just gonna say I just thought um
Charlie strehm also might be a good person to uh to interview and
I'd like to see somebody that represents the miners because I think that that's been really the one of the biggest problems in in this whole
situation that we're in is that um
That there must have just been some miscommunication issues between the developers and the miners and you've been talking to a lot
A lot of developers and and roger bear and I think we've just we've just been missing out on a point of view from the miners
Which I frankly I don't I don't talk to miners either. I don't know. I I would very much like to talk to the miners
I do feel their voice is missing maybe because of a translation issue or maybe we're just not getting through to them
And I also I worry about them being confused. I worry that they think they're not going to make money on the lightning network
I worry they think they're going to make more money on bitcoin unlimited
I'm not sure if these things are true
But I just want to like reach them and get them out there and talk to them and talk to them and talk to them
I'm not sure if these things are true, but I just want to like reach them and get them as much technical expertise
As I can gather from you guys and give to them. Jameson follow up anybody on that
Extremely hard question. What are we going to do if we don't scale both directions?
Yeah, well so far the only person i've even seen talking about that is jimmy song
And you know, he's got a number of medium posts where he's basically talking about
You know setting up other types of payment channel networks using the existing technology and to be quite honest we
Have considered stuff like that at bitgo. I mean as as this type of
Contention continues to increase and the economic incentives
Continue to increase for for companies to build their own solutions without waiting on protocol developers or miners or anyone else
Um people are going to innovate. You can't stop people from innovating
Excellent points, and I just want to thank you guys both for being on the show
I think we really did a good job of agreeing as well as disagreeing
And we got to all the different points that I wanted to talk about
And I just wanted to give you guys each a point here at the end to uh, maybe advertise some future projects or tell people
Where they can check you out on twitter, uh ret go ahead
Um, yeah, uh, you know, I I would guess i'd like to take this uh, I would I'd like to take this time to point out. Um
That actually I don't know. It's kind of another issue. I think nobody didn't ruin this. Um, but
jeez
I don't want to get into it. Uh, I was I was gonna say that um, I think that we have
I would like to see uh, I think we had a great discussion tonight
And I would like to see um, I I think
The people are are saying really emotional
reactive
Things on either side of the fence here because people are really invested in bitcoin
And and it's you know, it makes people feel really strongly one way or the other and what I would like to ask people is
Um, you know, look miners are signaling over 40% that they want to invest in bitcoin
Look miners are signaling over 40% that they want this thing
and so
You know just like consider it like look about what are what are the what are the points of that thing?
And i'd like to see on reddit. I think that there was this case where
Um, you know, they're
Bitcoin unlimited bitcoin xt they were considered altcoins. They weren't discussed on reddit
And I think that that honestly has has created more politics
At this point because I think that we have to agree that there there is a scaling debate going on
It's something that people are I have concerns about in bitcoin
And it would be much better if we could discuss these issues like we did on this show
Uh, I think rationally we could consider both sides both points of view
And um and and try to you know, not just
Um attack each other and be emotional about things. Um, so I don't know. That's sort of my plea. I guess
I agree with that. That's not contentious at all. Jameson. Go ahead
Sure, uh, so if anybody out there is on twitter, you can follow me at lop l-o-p-p
And I actually fully agree with the sentiments that were just presented regarding reddit
In fact, I wrote a medium article about it a few weeks ago talking about censorship and moderation and how reddit
And how reddit is a shit show in general. I have to say every bitcoin forum is a shit show
The reason for that is that every bitcoin forum is owned by a bitcoiner
And that bitcoin person has a vested interest in seeing their vision of bitcoin propagated and therefore they will you know
Make changes to the content of whatever uh site or forum they own in order to better suit
Their own vision. So that's why I really stick to twitter because
There aren't any bitcoiners that own twitter that can censor what i'm saying or moderate what i'm saying
And uh, you know, i'm really hopeful that maybe a platform like yours or some other
Uh type of completely new system will better enable us to talk to each other without having to worry
About those type of issues
Um, of course, there's also the the behavioral emotional stuff
Which i'm not so sure there really is a solution for
I try
Not to to fall into any of the easy
fallacious arguments of name calling and emotionalism and
And unfortunately, I actually get flamed a lot when I try to to calm people down. So
That may be a waste of my efforts to try to to broker peace between the two sides
At this point, um, and and as i've said many times, um
I'm just an observer. I mean I participate but but in a way i'm just observing this entire ecosystem as it evolves and
And it's still incredibly fascinating to me
Despite all of the vitriol and other things that i've had to endure
I don't plan on going anywhere regardless of what happens with any protocol upgrades hard forks soft forks
Whatever. Um, i'm i'm just here for the long haul because I think that
as bitcoin and cryptocurrency
Enthusiasts we have far more in common than we have different
We can certainly still agree upon some things such as that we like a nice predictable inflation rates
so
If all else fails, i'm sure we can still fall back on a few things that we agree upon
Thank you so much Jameson, and I I do agree
I'm glad that we were able to find points to agree on tonight
And I just wanted to thank our hundred or so live viewers and anyone that's watching now. Just give us a thumbs up
Give us a comment and continue the discussion down below because this is about everybody discussing this
And I think we got to a lot of great points tonight and I look forward to continuing this tomorrow night
And then on friday, we'll do the bitcoin group. So thanks so much for watching until next time
Bye. Bye
